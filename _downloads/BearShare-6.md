Editor's review <br />
What is BearShare? No it does not have anything to do with sharing a Bear, it is a Peer-to-peer file Sharing program. With BearShare you can get Music Files, Videos and more for free or little cost. <br />
<br />
Pros <br />
One very Big Pro is that BearShare is Free to download and use; another pro is that it is designed to run on Windows XP and uses Windows Media Player 9. It is only 7.8 MB in size with over 27,000,000 downloads, which if you know anything about Peer-to-Peer Networks then you know the more users the better, probably making it the biggest Pro of all. <br />
Another pro to BearShare is that it connects instantly, a powerful search engine along with the play list being genre sorted. There are some other great Pros to BearShare such as lightening fast downloads, advanced searching, resume downloading, chatting with other while you and they download, parental controls and being able to preview your files. Some say that when it comes to a Free Peer-to-Peer program you cannot get any better than BearShare. <br />
<br />
Cons <br />
There are some serious cons to BearShare such as someone can see what files you and your friends share. Another Con is that more times than not you have to pay for certain downloads. A media manager that arranges your computers media files. One other major downside to any free Peer-to-Peer networks is if you have Dialup then you can expect to spend quite a while downloading unless you are prepared to get the paid version which has the download accelerator inside. Many of the files you download cannot be burned onto a disk and often require a license to even listen to them. <br />
<br />
Summary <br />
I guess to sum this entire thing up, if you are looking for a free Peer-to-Peer program and do not mind having to pay for some of the files, or that if you have dialup you are going to be downloading for quite a while then BearShare is for you. Remember this is my own personal opinion and as such I give BearShare 7 out of ten for effort.</font></p></p>
