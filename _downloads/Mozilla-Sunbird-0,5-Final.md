<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>MozillaSunbird is a redevelopment of the Mozilla Calendar extension. Our goalis to produce a cross platform standalone calendar application based onMozilla s XUL user interface language. At the moment the "Sunbird" nameis a project name. It is not official and may change in the future.<br />
<br />
Our intended user is someone who uses Mozilla Firefox (or anotherbrowser) as his browser, Mozilla Thunderbird (or another mail client)as his mail client and wants a calendar application based on Mozilla.<br />
<br />
In addition, by focusing solely on standalone calendar, we believe wecan make some dents in the overall footprint and performance of thecalendar application by removing components and chrome we don t need.<br />
<br />
At the moment Sunbird is in an experimental stage. Although it is quite stable, we recommend it for testing purposes only. </p>
<div class="celltext_big"><br />
<br />
<strong>What s New</strong> in This Release:<br />
<br />
New storage architecture handles calendars with hundreds or thousands of events more responsively. <br />
More intuitive interface shows you more of what you need, and less of what you don t. <br />
Redesigned preferences allow you to easily customize Sunbird for your needs. <br />
Add-ons support allows you to extend Sunbird s functionality withextensions, themes, and language packs from addons.mozilla.org. <br />
New Windows installer makes it easier than ever for Windows users to install Sunbird. <br />
Better printing gives you more ways to print your calendars. Mac users can now print as well! <br />
24-hour views show you your entire day, not just a few hours. <br />
Reliable alarms ensure you are notified about events or tasks. <br />
Improved localization support means Sunbird can easily install, enable, and disable language packs. <br />
Vastly improved reliability makes it much more difficult to lose data. <br />
Many performance improvements... [ </div></p></p>
