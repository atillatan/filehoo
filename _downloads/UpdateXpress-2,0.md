<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">UpdateXpressis a network administration utility that dramatically simplifies thepropagation of updated files across the network. <br />
<br />
When a user double-clicks a shortcut on their local machineupdateXpress checks if any specified linked files or folders are newerthan those on the local drive and if so updates them before opening thedesired target file.<br />
<br />
With updateXpress a Network Administrator does not need to physicallyupdate client workstations when implementing software updates. Theyneed only change the appropriate files on the server to the newerversions and the next time the clients log in and start theirapplication updateXpress will automatically copy the updates to thecorrect location on the local drive before running the software.<br />
<br />
UpdateXpress was developed by SpecApps to assist in our own developmentwork as well as for many of our clients network manage</font></p></p>
