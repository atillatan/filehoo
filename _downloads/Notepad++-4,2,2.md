<br />
This project, based on Scintilla edit component (a very powerful editorcomponent) and written in C++ with pure win32 api (i.e. without MFC,that ensures the higher execution speed and smaller size of theprogram), is under the GPL Licence. <br />
<br />
This project is mature. However, as you can see it’.s a one-man-project, there’.re still some bugs and missing features. <br />
<br />
If you have any question or suggestion about this project, please dropme a mail, I’.ll love to hear from you. As well, if you have any featurerequest, you can always do the demand, but there’.s no warranty thatI’.ll implement it. <br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "Notepad plus plus":</strong></span><br />

<br />

It allows user to define his own language : not only the syntaxhighlighting keywords, but also the syntax folding keywords, commentkeywords and the operators.<br />
<br />
<strong>Multi-Document</strong><br />
You can edit several documents at the same time. <br />
<br />
<strong>Multi-View</strong><br />
You have two views at same time. That means you can visualize (edit) 2different documents at the same time. You can visualize (edit) in the 2views one document at 2 different positions as well. The modificationof document in one view will carry out in another view (i.e. you modifythe SAME document when you are in clone mode). <br />

<br />
