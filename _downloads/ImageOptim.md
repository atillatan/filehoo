ImageOptim is excellent for publishing images on the web (easily shrinks images “Saved for Web” in Photoshop). It's useful for making Mac and iPhone/iPad applications smaller (if you configure Xcode to allow better optimization).

ImageOptim removes EXIF meta­data, such as GPS position and camera's serial number, so that you can publish images without exposing private information (but there's an option to keep the meta­data if you need it).

### How does it work?

When you drag'n'drop images into ImageOptim's window it will run several image optimization tools automatically and combine their results, ensuring that you always get the smallest file.

See installation and usage instructions.

ImageOptim integrates well with macOS, so you can also drop files on ImageOptim's Dock icon, or use Services menu in Finder, or Markup menu on attached images in Apple Mail. ImageOptim can also be launched from command line or Sketch.

### A special option for even smaller files

If you enable Lossy minification you'll get smallest file sizes possible.

By default ImageOptim is very cautious and exactly preserves image quality, but if you allow it to change the quality — even only a little — it will be free to use much more aggressive optimizations that give the biggest results. You can configure lossy optimizations in ImageOptim's Preferences. ImageOptim can apply lossy compression not only to JPEG, but SVG, anim GIF and PNG as well!

### Open Source

ImageOptim is free, open-source soft­ware under terms of the GPL v2 or later. You can fork the code on GitHub and improve it! Feel free to contact me for assistance.

ImageOptim is sponsored by PSW GROUP. If you need an SSL certificate they have a special discount for ImageOptim users! Use the code IMAOPT10.
PNGOUT is bundled with permission of Ardfry Imaging, LLC and is not covered by the GPL.

### Frequent answers

**How does ImageOptim compare to TinyPNG, MozJPEG or Guetzli?**
You can get the same or better compression if you enable Lossy minification option in in ImageOptim preferences.

Tools like ImageAlpha/pngquant/TinyPNG/JPEGMini/MozJPEG make files smaller by using lossy compres­sion which lowers image quality, which ImageOptim doesn't do by default, but can if you allow it.

**Can I keep embedded copyright, camera information?**
Yes. Uncheck Strip JPEG metadata in Preferences.

It's slow on PNG files. How can I make it faster?
In preferences uncheck PNGOUT and Zopfli. Without these tools optimiza­tion will run much quicker, but will be a bit less effective.

**Will ImageOptim be in the App Store?**
No, and please beware of knock-offs in the App Store! Apple's has been selling three already.

ImageOptim is given for free on terms that basically say “you can do what­ever you want except taking this freedom away from others”. Apple does not allow such permissive terms. Apple requires all App Store users to accept DRM (copy protection) and legal restrictions in the iTunes EULA.

You can get ImageOptim here, DRM-free. Its license allows you to share it, modify it, use it in any country in the world — even sell it — if you don't forbid anybody else from doing the same.

You can donate to support the project.
