Realtime bandwith monitoring was never easier.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Requirements:</strong></span><br />
<br />
Windows 2000 or newer is required for "transparency" and "balloon hint" features<br />
If you are using Windows 95 you will have to install an update fromMicrosoft that contains the IP-Helper API (IPHLPAPI.DLL). As far as iknow this DLL is included in the Internet Explorer 5.x installationpackage.<br />
Windows NT 4.0: Service Pack 4 or newer is required<br />
x64 versions of XP and Vista: NetMeter works fine on these 64-bitoperating systems although it is not a native 64-bit binary. VistaUltimate 64-bit is my current development platform. Nevertheless i willcontinue to maintain compatibility down to Windows 95.<br />
