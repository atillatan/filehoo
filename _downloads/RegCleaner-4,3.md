<p><font size="2"><p>RegCleaner deletes registry entries. You can delete DLLs with theShared DLLs feature, and shortcut files with the Startup feature. Youdon t even have to know what the registry actually is to be able to useRegCleaner. <br />
<br />
You can use RegCleaner because it s a good idea to keep the registry as clean as possible. Here are some examples to help you understand how RegCleaner can truly help you:<br />
<br />
Say you ve accidentally destroyed a nice shareware program what has a30-day trial period. Later on, when you notice that it s beendestroyed, you try reinstalling it, only to find out that you can t,because the program thinks that you re just trying to get another 30days. <br />
<br />
If you first remove the program s registry entries, however, you mayvery well be able to reinstall the software and recover your trialperiod again.<br />
<br />
You ve found that your favorite program is an older version, and youwant to download the latest whiz-bang version. The program, however,doesn t provide any uninstall utility, so you simply destroy its filesand cross your fingers. But, as fate would have it, when you try toinstall the latest version, you see a dialog box such as this:<br />
"Please uninstall the old version of this program before attempting to run this installation."</p></p></p>
