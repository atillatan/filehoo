<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">WithExeShield it s very easy to convert your applications into sharewaresoftware with little to no effort, and maximum protection againstpiracy, backdating, reverse-engineering or any kind of tampering. <br />
<br />
ExeShield will protect virtually any Win32 executable, including:<br />
Visual Basic <br />
Delphi <br />
C++ <br />
C++ Builder <br />
PowerBasic <br />
MASM <br />
Visual Studio<br />
<br />
ExeShield uses several different techniques for protecting your application. <br />
<br />
Special code is added to defeat most Debuggers and Monitors includingW32Dasm, SoftIce, TRW 2000, Turbo Debugger, Sourcer, Filemon , ExeSpy, ResSpy, RegMon and Memory Monitor which are tools most crackers are using today. <br />
<br />
Your protected executable is also modified so it can t run without ExeShield. <br />
<br />
Even if the protected executable was pulled out of the protectionshell, it would not execute -- since ExeShield modifies parts of theprogram. <br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "ExeShield":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Anti-debugging &amp;. Anti-monitoring Protection<br />
Encryption Technology<br />
Detects backdating or reinstallation to gain additional usage<br />
Secure Encryption Protection<br />
Reliable Machine Locking Protection<br />
Invisible software-based protection requiring no dongles<br />
Create evaluation copies by days or uses<br />
No source code modification<br />
No dependency files to distribute<br />
Lease your software<br />
Protect your application in less than 5 minutes<br />
<br />

<font size="2"><strong>What s New</strong> in This Release:<br />
<br />
Added more cracking tool checking.<br />
Added new feature, "Online Registration" under the help file. If you change<br />
or upgrade your machine, you will need a new license file for ExeShield. This<br />
feature allows you to register the software over the internet without contacting<br />
us for a license file. This feature is also being tested so we can eventually add<br />
this into Exeshield so you can use this with your protected software.<br />
If you are using dongles to protect your software, you can now tie<br />
in the Product Identifier to the dongle if you need to charge for upgrades. This allows you<br />
to change the product Identifier on newer versions, and send a new<br />
dongle/software to your customer.<br />
For languages that can t retrieve environment variables, a file called<br />
REGNUM.TXT will be created in the users TEMP directory containing the<br />
registration number that is located on the Splash Screen.<br />
Under "File" you can now check for updates on startup..</font></div></p>
