<p><font size="2"><p>Unstoppable copier is great for recovering files from scratched CD s or defective floppy/hard disks. <br />
<br />
Normally when your computer is unable to copy a file from a damageddisk it will abort and delete the portition of the file it has copied. <br />
<br />
Unstoppable Copier will continue copying the file right to the end. anyunrecoverable data after many retries is replaced with blanks. Thiswill allow you to truely recover every byte of information that isavailable for recovery. <br />
<br />
Unstoppable copier allows you to specify a single file, a group usingwildcards or if you wish, select a starting folder and the program willcopy all data from it and any sub folders it may contain. <br />
<br />
Unstoppable copier doesnt just need to be used for copying files form defective disks, it can be used to transfer any files.</p>
