<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">CDRWIN is the smallest complete CD burning software <br />
CDRWIN is a CD recording program supporting binary (.BIN), cue sheets (.CUE), overburning, MP3 burning, disc copy, track ripping, and much more. <br />
<br />
CDRWIN is a software that allows you record DVD and CD. <br />
<br />
Here are some key features of "CDRWIN": <br />
<br />
· Supports the recording of AUDIO, CDROM (Mode1), CDROM-XA (Mode2), CD-I, Mixed-Mode, and Multisession discs. <br />
· Unique CUE SHEET scripting language gives you 100% custom control <br />
over the disc layout. No two second gaps between tracks like other software! <br />
· Powerful disc backup utility that preserves the exact layout of the original disc including all subcode information. <br />
· ISO9660 disc mastering (with Joliet long filename support for Windows 95/98/NT). <br />
· Supports Karaoke CD+G discs (on compatible equipment). <br />
· Automatic MP3 file decoding... MP3 files can be recorded to an audio disc without converting them to WAV files first. <br />
· Supports CD-TEXT discs (on compatible equipment) and includes a graphical text editor. <br />
· Bootable CDROM support. <br />
· Only disc-at-once software that supports all CDROM types on the Philips/Kodak/HP family of CD recorders. <br />
· Supports disc UPC and track ISRC numbers (on most recorders). <br />
· Supports disc transporters/duplicators from Kodak and Discmatic for fast and unattended disc replication. <br />
<br />
<br />
Requirements: <br />
<br />
· Windows 2000/XP <br />
· MP3 Codec (Windows Media Player 10 or Lame) <br />
· 256 MB RAM <br />
· Pentium compatible CPU <br />
· Mouse <br />
<br />
<br />
Limitations: <br />
<br />
· all recording operations are limited to 1X speed. You are entitled to use this version for a maximum of 30 days. Note: A few recorder models do not support 1x recording speed, so the demos will not work with them (the error "Unable to set writing speed" will appear).</font></p></p>
