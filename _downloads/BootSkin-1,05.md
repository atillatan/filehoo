<p><font size="2">BootSkin is a program that can change your boot screen <br />
Stardock BootSkin is an application that allows users to change their Windows 2000 and Windows XP boot screens. <br />
<br />
Unlike other programs that can change the Windows XP boot screens <br />
, BootSkin does so in a safe manner. It doesn't patch the Windows XP kernel. Nor does it require the user to download replacement Windows XP kernels to do so. <br />
<br />
Boot screens that use BootSkin are typically under 20K compared to other boot screen programs whose files are over 2 MEGABYTES. <br />
<br />
And best of all, BootSkin is free for non-commercial use. <br />
