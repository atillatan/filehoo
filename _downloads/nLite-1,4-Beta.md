<p><font size="2"><p>nLite is a GUI for permanent Windows component removal by your choice.<br />
<br />
After removal there is an option to make bootable image ready for burning on cd or testing in virtual machines. <br />
<br />
With nLite you will be able to have Windows installation which oninstall doesn t include, or even contain on cd, unwanted components.<br />
<br />
Mainly, it s a little bit of a slipstreamer, customizer, reducer and iso creator all in one package.<br />
<br />
<strong>Quick overview </strong>:<br />
<br />
1. Slipstream - After you extract it to any folder and ran it, you canbrowse and point to folder on hard drive which contains your Windowsinstallation.<br />
If you pointed to right folder with i386 in it and Windows id files,nLite will detect if you have already slipstreamed SP1 or SP2, and ifnot it will change Browse button to Slipstream, when pressed it asksfor Service Pack installation file (or update.exe if you extracted it).Then it Slipstreams it passively. Or you can configure your existingversion without slipstreaming.<br />
<br />
2. Customize/Reduce - Choose which components to remove from yourWindows installation permanently. It s version independent, it spossible because I m not using filelists, well, allmost. There is onlyan inf-filelist which then gets parsed for used files, so ~95% of filenames are automatically generated from your own inf s. The other 5% aremanually added. Most likely nLite will work with future versions ofWindows XP without any problem.<br />
<br />
3. Advanced Options - Make sure to keep Data directory with nLite andall the files in it unrenamed. Added automatic hacking of syssetup.dllfor OOBE disabling (if you choose to remove it, this will not crackActivation). SFC is entirely disabled too simply by copying hacked dllfrom Data and adjusting registry. Many options to add in the future,priority so far was on reduction issues.<br />
<br />
4. Make ISO - This section is using external file datacdimage.exe whichI believe don t need introducing. When reduction process finishes youcan copy additional files to installation directory and then press MakeISO, it will ask you for desired ISO name and location. <br />
