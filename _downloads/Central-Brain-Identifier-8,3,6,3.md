<p><font size="2">Central Brain Identifier is a free AMD processor identification utility <br />
Central Brain Identifier is designed to provide detailed recognition and obtaining the most complete extended information for all AMD processors. <br />
<br />
Central Brain Identifier it recognizes more than 40 various models of the AMD processors. <br />
<br />
Central Brain Identifier shows not only general information about the processor, but also allows to determine its important technical features, such as processor core, core revision, the date of announce, a nominal processor frequency, the components of the PowerNow, an OPN number! <br />
<br />
Technology and also <br />
calculates an XP-Rating for the processors having a Model Number. <br />
<br />
Here are some key features of "Central Brain Identifier": <br />
<br />
· Complete and precise identification of the AMD processors. <br />
· P-rating calculation and OPN determination. <br />
· The real-time CPU frequency, voltage and temperature monitoring. <br />
· An entering the processor the low power state of Stop Grant. <br />
· On the fly FID transition for mobile AMD processors. <br />
· Performance state tables searching and decoding. <br />
· DRAM timing configuration of a huge number of chipsets. <br />
· An ability to change the feature bits of the processor. <br />
· Quick CPU name string modification. <br />
· FSB/DRAM frequency control for the nForce2 chipset on the fly. <br />
· An advanced tuning of VIA V-Link bus speed parameters. <br />
· An enhanced set of tweaks to optimize the performance of DRAM with the nForce2 chipset. <br />
· HyperTransprt multiplier and bus width change. <br />
· Memory frequency change for the AMD64 platform. <br />
