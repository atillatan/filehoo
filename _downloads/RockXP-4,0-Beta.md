<font color="#ff0000"><strong>Note: Some antivirus and antispyware programs flagRockXP as being infected/malware, although the application is perfectlysafe and does not pose a threat to your system. This is called a falsepositive . The term false positive is used when antivirus softwarewrongly classifies an innocuous ( inoffensive ) file as a virus. Theincorrect detection may be due to heuristics or to an incorrect virussignature in a database. [Similar problems can occur with antitrojan orantispyware software.]</strong></font></p></p></p>
