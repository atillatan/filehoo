<p><font size="2">Open source software for 3D modeling, animation, rendering which also features a game engineBlender is an open source software for 3D modeling, rendering, animation, post-production, interactive creation and playback. Available for Windows, Linux, Irix, Sun Solaris, FreeBSD or Mac OS X. <br />
<br />
Modeling <br />
· A range of 3D object types including polygon meshes, NURBS surfaces, bezier and B-spline curves, metaballs, vector fonts (TrueType, PostScript, OpenType) <br />
· 'Smooth proxy' style catmull-clark subdivision surfaces <br />
· Boolean mesh functions <br />
· Editing functions such as extrude, bevel, cut, spin, screw, warp, subdivide, noise, smooth Soft selection editing tools for organic modeling <br />
· Python scripting access for custom tools <br />
<br />
Animation <br />
· Armature (skeleton) deformation with forward/inverse kinematics, auto skinning and interactive 3D paint for vertex weighting <br />
· Non-linear animation mixer with automated walkcycles along paths <br />
· Constraint system <br />
· Vertex key framing for morphing, with controlling sliders <br />
· Character animation pose editor <br />
· Animatable lattice deformation <br />
· 'Ipo' system integrates both motion curve and traditional key-frame editing <br />
· Audio playback, mixing and editing support <br />
for sound synchronisation <br />
· Python scripting access for custom and procedural animation effects <br />
<br />
Realtime 3D/game creation <br />
· Graphical editor for defining interactive behavior without programming <br />
· Collision detection and dynamics simulation <br />
· Python scripting API for sophisticated control and AI, fully defined advanced game logic <br />
· Supports all OpenGL lighting modes, including transparencies, Animated and reflection-mapped textures <br />
· Playback of games and interactive 3D content without compiling or preprocessing <br />
· Audio, using the fmod toolkit <br />
· Multi-layering of Scenes for overlay interfaces <br />
<br />
Rendering <br />
· Very fast inbuilt raytracer <br />
· Integral support for the famous Yafray render engine <br />
· Oversampling, motion blur, post-production effects, fields, non-square pixels <br />
· Environment maps, halos, lens flares, fog <br />
· Various surface shaders such as Lambert, Phong, Oren-nayar, Blinn, Toon <br />
· Edge rendering for toon shading <br />
· Procedural Textures <br />
· Ambient Occlusion <br />
· Radiosity solver <br />
· Export scripts available for external renderers such as Renderman (RIB), Povray, Virtualight <br />
· UV texture editor with various mesh unwrap modes <br />
<br />
Interface <br />
· Flexible user configurable window layout <br />
· Powerful object-oriented data system <br />
· Anti-aliased fonts with international translation support <br />
· Windows for animation curves/keys, schematic scene diagram, non-linear video sequence editing, character animation action editor, non-linear animation mixer, image/UV editing, file/image selection and file management <br />
· Inbuilt text editor for annotations and editing Python scripts <br />
· Consistent interface across multiple platforms <br />
<br />
Files <br />
· Save all scene data in a single .blend file <br />
· .blend format supports compression, digital signatures, encryption, forwards/backwards compatibility and can be used as a library to link to from other .blend files <br />
· Read / Write TGA, JPG, PNG, Iris, SGI Movie, IFF, AVI and Quicktime GIF, TIFF, PSD, MOV (Windows and Mac OS X) <br />
· Native import and export for DXF, Inventor and VRML files, with python scripts available for many other 3D formats <br />
· Create stand-alone executables containing interactive 3D content or play back with the 3d web browser plugin</font></p></p>
