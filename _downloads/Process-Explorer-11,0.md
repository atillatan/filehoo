<p><font size="2"><p>Process Explorer will show you information about which handles and DLLs processes have opened or loaded.<br />
<br />
The Process Explorer display consists of two sub-windows. <br />
<br />
The top window always shows a list of the currently active processes,including the names of their owning accounts, whereas the informationdisplayed in the bottom window depends on the mode that ProcessExplorer is in: if it is in handle mode you’.ll see the handles that theprocess selected in the top window has opened. if Process Explorer isin DLL mode you’.ll see the DLLs and memory-mapped files that theprocess has loaded. <br />
<br />
Process Explorer also has a powerful search capability that willquickly show you which processes have particular handles opened or DLLsloaded.<br />
