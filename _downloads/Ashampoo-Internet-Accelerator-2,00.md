<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">Ashampoo Internet Accelerator will boost the speed of your internet connection by changing Windows default parameters. <br />
<br />
Many windows settings work in harmony in order to get the best out of an<br />
available internet connection. Unfortunately, the factory design of these<br />
settings means that they are often not optimised for a particular connection<br />
type, or they are adjusted by a newly installed software product unasked.<br />
The consequences are plain to see: the computer can`t get the best out of<br />
your internet connection. As a user, this means you have to wait longer<br />
until web pages have loaded in your browser or until internet downloads are<br />
finished. <br />
<br />
For beginners and for most professionals, it simply isn`t possible to find<br />
the settings necessary for the fine tuning of the internet in the registry -<br />
let alone to edit them. No problem: the Ashampoo Internet Accelerator 2 will<br />
be pleased to complete this job for you! <br />
<br />
A slow internet connection costs time and gets on your nerves. For this<br />
reason, taking the time to optimise the settings is almost considered a must<br />
- particularly since an optimisation in terms of speed doesn t come with any<br />
additional cost, neither for a hardware extension nor for the software, as<br />
the Ashampoo Internet Accelerator 2 can be used completely free of charge.<br />
<br />
