<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">TrojanRemover was written to aid in the removal of Trojan Horses and InternetWorms when standard anti-virus software has either failed to detect theproblem or is unable to effectively eliminate it.<br />
<br />
<strong>Trojan Remover s database currently contains 16903 individualtrojan/worm signatures (including variants) [as at 8th October 2005].</strong><br />
<br />
The majority of Virus and Trojan Scanners are well able to detectmalicious Trojan Horses and Internet Worms but are not always veryefficient in removing them once they have been triggered. <br />
<br />
Trojan Remover was written specifically to carry out such a removalwithout the user having to manually edit system files, including theRegistry. <br />
<br />
The program also removes the additional system modifications someTrojans carry out which are ignored by other Virus and Trojan Scanners.<br />
<br />
Trojan Remover examines the system files, including Windows Registryand will determine the programs and files that are loaded at boot time.The majority of Trojan Horses (once triggered) are loaded this way.<br />
<br />
Trojan Remover will scan ALL the files loaded at boot time for RemoteAccess Trojans ( backdoors , like NetBus, SubSeven, Optix Pro, BackOrifice etc.), Internet Worms and other malware. <br />
<br />
For each identified Trojan Horse, Worm, or other malware, TrojanRemover will pop up an alert screen showing the file location and name.it will offer to remove the program s reference from the system filesand allow you to rename the file to stop its activation.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Limitations:</strong></span><br />
<br />
The program will work for a full 30 days</font></p>
