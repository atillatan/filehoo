<br />
PestPatrol detects what anti-virus software misses, and is designed to work in conjunction with anti-virus software.<br />
<br />
How does PestPatrol identify possible threats? PestPatrol is similar toanti-virus products, but instead of scanning for viruses, it scans forSpyware and Trojans, and even tools and utilities used by hackers andmaybe even trusted employees. Used along with anti-virus software,PestPatrol will keep you safe from malicious objects, commonly referredto as Pests. <br />
<br />
PestPatrol allows you to delete offensive files. Once Pest Patrol detects a pest, you have the option to delete the file, quarantine the file orsimply to receive an alert about the file. You can even examine thepest and receive additional information about it from an extensive PestDictionary.<br />
<br />
If you don t want to delete the file∆í.you can quarantine it until youhave time to take a closer look. Once the pest is detected, you cansafely quarantine the pest to a separate directory until you have timeto examine the file more closely.<br />
<br />
PestPatrol offers an exclude feature. The exclude feature allows you toexclude a certain files from the scan. For example, if you are asecurity officer, you may have some of these tools on your computer forevaluation or testing purposes... with the exclude feature, you caneliminate the bother of being advised of pests you already know about.<br />
<br />
How does PestPatrol differ from anti-virus products? Anti-virusproducts focus on viruses. PestPatrol focuses on every other sort ofcomputer pest, including ANSI bombs, answering machine hacks, carding,denial of service attack tools, disassemblers, virus droppers, hackingguides, hostile Java, icq, key loggers, mail bombers, passwordcrackers, phreaking, surreptitious remote control, remote monitoring,network scanning, sniffers, spoofers, spyware, surveillance, Trojans,Trojan creation tools, virus creation tools, virus writing tools, andword lists used by password crackers. <br />
<br />
As a result, PestPatrol detects more such pests, and is much faster than anti-virus products.<br />
