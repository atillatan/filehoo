<p><font size="2">CmosPwd - CMOS and BIOS password recovery tool <br />
CmosPwd is a cmos/bios password recovery application. <br />
<br />
CmosPwd works and compiles under Dos-Win9x, Windows NT/W2K/XP/2003, Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD. <br />
<br />
Typical Usage for DOS and all Windows users: <br />
<br />
1) Identify your BIOS manufacturer (usually displayed at boot-up) <br />
<br />
2) Start in DOS, or start a DOS session in Windows 95/98/ME. For Windows NT or Windows 2000 boot from a DOS or Windows 95/98 boot disk (you can find boot disks at www.AnswersThatWork.com) <br />
, and run CMOSPWD from your boot floppy (or another floppy). <br />
<br />
3) C: [Enter] cd CMOSPWD [Enter] <br />
<br />
4) Type CMOSPWD at the DOS prompt and press Enter. <br />
<br />
5) CMOSPWD will display a list of possibilities. Use the possibilities itemised against your BIOS manufacturer. Remember : <br />
<br />
a) For AWARD BIOSes, use the Numeric Keypad (with NumLock ON). <br />
b) AWARD 4.50PG BIOS always accepts "AWARD_SW", or "d8on", or "589589". <br />
c) Old Phoenix BIOSes will accept "phoenix". <br />
<br />
6) If the standard method does not work, then try to kill the CMOS password with CMOSPWD /K (and press Enter), and then see if you can get into the CMOS without a password. If you can, you successfully "killed" the old CMOS password. DO NOT KILL THE CMOS ON LAPTOPS! <br />
<br />
On laptops, the password is usually stored in an eeprom on the motherboard, <br />
you need an eeprom programmer (electronic device) to retrieve it. <br />
<br />
