The main difference is that KaZaA Litehas been modified so that it doesnot have any of the spyware, adware and advertising usually included inKazaa Media Desktop.

Most of this addedfunctionality is provided by the K++ loader and the KL Extensionsplugin. <br />

It adds many features missing from theoffical KMD client, such as an intelligent download accelerator,auto-search more, fake file analyzer, IP blocker, and a fresh new look.It also contains some very handy tools as well as neutralising all adand spyware. <br />
