<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">IRC server for windows. It can be used with any existing IRC client and is easy to set up (runs "out of box"). It claims to be faster than any other windows irc server. The code is designed and tested for an extreme number of network users and channels. The server is light weight and uses very little ram and cpu resources. It offers many configuration options including custom server reply/error messages, server relaying (ofcoarse) as well as a variety of security features like nick banning, CTCP flood protection, anti-spoof ping and many more. beware ircd is fully compatibile with RFC1459 and supports all or nearly commands.</font></p></p>
