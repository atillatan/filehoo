<p><font size="2">UPX-iT is a Win32 GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) for a well known packing programm named UPX.<br />
<br />
UPX, a free DOS command-line tool, is an extendable , portable, high-performance executable packer for many different executable formats.<br />
<br />
The primary use for UPX-iT is for software developers to compress theirprograms before distributing them to their customers or posting them onthe internet. <br />
<br />
This makes the final file sizes much smaller (up to 75% smaller) forfaster file transfers. However, the average user can use the tool tocompress files on their systems to increase free disk space.</font></p>
