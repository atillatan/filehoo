<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">BitLord is a p2p file-sharing program fully compatible with .torrent files, which is one of the most popular p2p protocol designed for high-speed distribution of 100MB or GB-sized files. BitLord supports simultaneous downloads, download queue, selected downloads in torrent package, fast-resume, chatting, disk cache, speed limits, port mapping, proxy, and IP-filter. <br />
<br />
Version 1.1 adds integrated Web browser</font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font size="2">Downloading torrent files isn't something we'd recommend for kids, and definitely not without supervision. BitLord makes that twice as clear, with a link on its toolbar to an X-rated chat forum and a colorful search function that looks like advertising and includes returns for what can be diplomatically described as "adult-only content." <br />
<br />
The interface is very reminiscent of the original torrent app, BitTorrent, although the colorful icons add a bit of zing to the layout and make it slightly easier to tell one function from the next. The most useful change is the addition of torrent-managing icons, although they were located in the lower-left section of the screen--not exactly the easiest place to see them. The search, chat, and gaming functions are all based on Internet Explorer 6, so it's hard to tell how secure those connections are. On the other hand, a dedicated Web browser integrated with a torrent client has the potential to be phenomenally useful. <br />
<br />
BitLord's download speeds weren't noticeably different from other torrent clients, so even though the innovations were appreciated, the confusing and redundant layout should be improved before we give it a stronger recommendation. </font></p></p>
