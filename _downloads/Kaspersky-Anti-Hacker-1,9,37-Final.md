<p><font size="2"><p>Kaspersky Anti-Hacker is a personal firewall application, that willprovide full-scale protection for PC, running Windows, from all theattempts of non-authorized access to data, as well as from the hackerattacks both from Internet and Intranet.<br />
<br />
Kaspersk Anti-Hacker provides control over the computer activity on the base of two-level analysis of system network activity. <br />
<br />
<strong>Tracking activity of Internet-connected applications (high -level operations). </strong>Integrated analysis of activity of such Internet- connectedapplications like Web-browsers, mail applications, file transferapplication, etc. <br />
<br />
<strong>Packet filtration of incoming and outgoing data (low-level operations).</strong> At this level Kaspersky Anti-Hacker analyses directly the packets, sent or received by computer. <br />
<br />
<strong>Filtration rules setting</strong> <br />
<br />
According to the user tasks software allows for creation or changingany set of rules for the tracking of applications activity as well as for packet filtration.<br />
<br />
Ability to set up special security rules for the internet-connectedapplications can be represented in Internet access to be allowed ordenied for the particular application depending on its type - mailclient, internet-pager, web-browser, etc., or to allow specific typefor activity for each concrete application (i.e. to set remote servicesand addresses with whose the application can interact). <br />
<br />
On setting packet filtration rules, it s possible to allow or to denytransferring data of specific types. The decision on the followingactions with the packet is taken on the base of analysis of theinformation stored in the packet header: sender or recipient sIP-address, data transfer</a>protocol to be used, etc. This type of rules can be applied to allapplications. Packet filtration also provides effective protectionagainst hacker attacks.<br />
<br />
<strong>Customized security levels</strong> <br />
<br />
Depending on your tasks, Kaspersky™. Anti-Hacker allows for makingchoice among the five security levels starting with complete protectionturn-off up to total block of all Internet connections, for each ofwhose levels you can specify security and packet filtration rules. <br />
<br />
<strong>Efficient protection against known types of hacker attacks</strong> <br />
<br />
Kaspersky™. Anti-Hacker partly functions in automatic mode. AttackDetector provides reliable defense against such known types of hackerattacks like port scanning, ping, etc. <br />
<br />
On choosing some security levels you can also use additional securitytool - Stealth mode. Thanks to SmartStealth™. technology it becomes moredifficult to detect your computer from outside. In this mode anynetwork activity is prohibited if not explicitly allowed by the userrules. This mode allows for successful prevention of hacker attacksincluding DoS (Denial of Service), while having no negative influenceon the user performance. <br />
<br />
<strong>Automatic self-learning system</strong> <br />
<br />
Kaspersky™. Anti-Hacker contains an ability to expand the list ofsecurity roles for Internet-connected application with theself-learning function. If an event occurs which is not described bythe predefined rules, you can add the method of its handling to thelist. In this way you can create security profile, which will ideallymeet your requirements. <br />
<br />
<strong>Check for integrity of executable files</strong> <br />
<br />
Kaspersky™. Anti-Hacker provides applications protection from theunauthorized attempts to substitute their original executable files. Ifthis kind of substitution detected there is an option to Block anyfurther network activity of this application, due to all other rules inthis list will be disabled. or to continue to trust to this applicationwithout making any changes in its rules. Check for executable filesintegrity is performed on the on the base of CRC sums, first calculatedon file appearance in the system, and further periodic checking oft</p></p></p>
