<p><font size="2">Editor's Review - AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition <br />
AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition is the basic solution from Grisoft Labs designed to protect your computer against viral threats. With its simple interface, Explorer context menu integration and powerful scan engine, this program can be used to secure your computer against viruses. However, since this is the free version, you won't get support, anti-spam protection, firewall or anti-spy protection. <br />
<br />
AVG installation components include a 'Resident Shield' which provides on-access scanning of files and an 'Email scanner' which will either detect your default email client or it can be manually configured (for advanced users). Automatic scans can be scheduled to be run repeatedly at intervals of your choice. You can choose between low priority (slow, but with less memory usage) and high priority (faster, but using more memory resources) automated scans. Manual scans allow you to scan separately files, folders, shell extensions, system areas. Un-repaired files can be stored in the 'Virus vault' until they will be cured or deleted. <br />
<br />
After testing the program using the EICAR (European Expert Group for IT Security) test files, I noticed that AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition has passed the test regarding files downloaded using both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Some of the malicious files have been detected by its on-access scanner, 'Resident Shield' , while others were detected after a regular system scan. <br />
<br />
The interface is nicely designed and it makes the program very easy to use. Configuring its settings is easy even for computer rookies. While running in the background, the system resources usage is low, so it wont affect the speed of you computer. <br />
<br />
Pluses: <br />

Drawbacks / flaws: <br />
<br />
In conclusion: Combined with other free solutions such as a firewall or an anti-spy provided by the same producer, this application might prove to be a part of a complete security solution for you. <br />
