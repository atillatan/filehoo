Cute FTP Home is an File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client that is used to transfer files between your computer and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers. <br />
<br />
Whether you are publishing a Web page, downloading the latest digital images, music, or software, or if you are just transferring large files between your home and office, CuteFTP Home gets the job done every time. <br />
<br />
Cute FTP Home is used to transfer files of any size and/or type, including Web pages, multi-media files, or other documents to and from a file transfer server over FTP, the standard for moving files across the Internet. <br />
<br />
Cute FTP Home assures efficient, reliable, secure connections and transfers over FTP (FTP over SSL/TLS). Typical uses include: <br />
· Upload your web pages to your ISP's FTP Server for viewing in a web browser <br />
· Upload work files to an FTP server. <br />
· Upload your auction images to an FTP Server <br />
· Upload or download <br />
multimedia files such as music, images or video files <br />
· Download the latest game patches, programs or game demos from participating FTP servers <br />
· Download large files faster than when using your Web browser <br />
· Backup critical files to an FTP server in case your system crashes <br />
<br />
Cute FTP Home is similar to a web browser. You enter an "FTP" address instead of an "HTTP" address and it transfers files instead of opening them. Additionally, it lets you change filenames, delete files or folders, or edit a remote document using its internal editor. <br />
<br />
Here are some key features of "CuteFTP XP": <br />
<br />
· Standard FTP - Compatible with any industry standard FTP server. <br />
· FTP over SSL (FTPS) - Strong 128-bit SSL negotiates connections and encrypts the data stream. <br />
· Step-by-step Connection Wizard - Easily setup your first FTP connection. <br />
· XP Color Icons - High-colored icons even when operating on non-XP operating systems (Windows 2000, 2003, etc.). <br />
· Configuration Options - Multiple controls for customizing the look and feel of CuteFTP. <br />
· Advanced Search - Find files and folders easily, by name, size or creation/modification date, whether they are on your local computer or a remote server. <br />
· Podcast Manager - Automatically create and update your Podcast RSS feed when you use CuteFTP to manage your Podcast files. It even includes a Podcast subscription manager that automatically downloads new episodes, or lets you select only the ones that sound interesting. <br />
· Local Backup - Quickly and easily back up your computer to a remote server for added data security. <br />
· Integrated Editor - Perform quick edits of remote Web pages or other documents using a powerful integrated text editor. <br />
· Filtered Listings - Choose what to display in either pane to facilitate the process of downloading groups of files while ignoring others. <br />
· Transfer Resume - Automatically restart interrupted transfers or manually restart paused transfers from the point it left off. <br />
· Scheduled Transfers - Set up transfers to occur at a future date or time and optionally in a recurring manner. <br />
· Concurrent Transfers - Transfer more than one file at the same time. <br />
· Multi-part Transfers - speed up large file transfers by splitting files into multiple parts and then transferring each part concurrently. <br />
· Turbo Transfer - Automatic Mode Z file compression and multi-part transfers for the fastest possible throughput. <br />
