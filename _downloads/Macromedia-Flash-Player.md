<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">Macromedia''s Shockwave Player allows you to view interactive web content like games, business presentations, entertainment and advertisements (just what the Web needs - more ways to view ads!). The package includes both Shockwave and Flash Players and is a stand alone installation. You can download the file to install at a later date or use it to reinstall the player on a fresh version of Windows. The single download package makes it much easier to troubleshoot problems and you don''t have to go through the active download process each time you need to install the player. According to a Macromedia security bulletins, Shockwave Player 10.1.3.018 fixes security problems. They say that critical vulnerabilities have been identified that could allow an attacker who successfully exploits these vulnerabilities to take control of the affected system. A malicious file must be loaded in the Player by the user for an attacker to exploit these vulnerabilities. Adobe categorizes this as a critical update and recommends affected users update to version 10.1.3.018.</font></p></p>
