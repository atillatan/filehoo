<p><font size="2"><p>Hot CPU Tester Pro is a system health and stability tester. It willtest CPU, chipset and virtually all parts of motherboard forerrors/bugs. <br />
<br />
Hot CPU Tester Pro is a burn-in test with uniquely designed state ofthe art DefectTrack engine. DefectTrack is a technology developed by7Byte to diagnose systems regarding its stability and in general,computer s health. Hot CPU Tester is currently being used in many labsand governmental organizations around the world, as a reliablestability testing utility. <br />

<br />
Hot CPU Tester Pro 4 is consisted of several test modules tostress-test each component within a system. Defective parts are mostlikely for to fail while they are under a heavy load, when the heatproduction is at its highest. <br />
<br />
The testing modules intentionally stress all components to theirmaximum limits to assess their integrity. Unstable parts cannot endurethese pressures and will fail the tests, allowing the opportunity foran upgrade or exchange before the PC is released into a productionenvironment. <br />
<br />
It is recommended that Hot CPU Tester should run for at least six hoursto fully check the system. If a system is stable under hard conditionsfor six hours, it is unlikely to generate errors during normaloperating conditions.<br />
