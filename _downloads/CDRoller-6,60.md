<p><font size="2">CDRoller - toolset to manage your CDs/DVDs &amp; more <br />
CDRoller is a powerful yet easy-to-use set of low- and high-level Data and Audio CD management utilities integrated into a common intuitive shell. <br />
<br />
CDRoller is a useful CD management and browser tool. <br />
<br />
Here are some key features of "CDRoller": <br />
<br />
· Effectively retrieves the data off the discs created by "drag and drop" CD/DVD writing software, such as well-known Roxio (Adaptec) and Ahead Nero software packages, CeQuadrat's PacketCD, Instant Write, B's CLiP and others. <br />
· Recovers CD and DVD data created by standalone devices that record directly onto disks, including: Sony digital cameras, DVD camcorders, personal DVD recorders, etc. <br />
· "On-the-fly" unpacks the files initially compressed <br />
by Roxio (Adaptec) DirectCD. <br />
· Retrieves back up files from the discs recorded in several stages (multisession discs). <br />
· Includes a built-in UDF Reader. There is no need to install a third-party software, for example Roxio (Adaptec) UDF Reader driver. <br />
· Finds and retrieves the lost files on UDF discs, including: accidently deleted files, files on quick-formatted disc, files on incorrectly closed disc, etc. <br />
· Rescues the data from scratched, damaged or defective discs. <br />
· Provides direct access to the hardware, bypassing the Windows File System. Looks for the lost tracks (sessions) every time when you insert a new disc into the drive <br />
· Digitally extracts audio tracks into a wide set of wave formats. <br />
· Tests CD readability. <br />
· Extracts ISO Image file. <br />
· Catalogs files and folders into CD library. <br />
· All features are integrated into a common and easy-to-use intuitive shell. User Interface is similar to well-known Windows 95 File Manager (Windows Explorer), with file property pages, pop-up (context) menus and drag-and-drop support. <br />
<br />
<br />
CD/DVD Data Recovery: Unfortunately, there is a lot of factors that can cause you to lose access to the data on your disks. System or power failures, hardware problems, media and CD/DVD mastering software problems... Often, when a disc becomes inaccessible more than a single factor has contributed to the problem. Fortunately, many of such problems that prevent "normal" access to the data can be bypassed when using CDRoller. <br />
<br />
Requirements: <br />
<br />
· Intel Pentium or compatible CPU, <br />
· 64 MB of RAM, <br />
· 5 MB free hard disk space for program installation and some additional space for CD images, <br />
· CD/DVD drive(s). The devices with IDE or SCSI interfaces are highly recommended under Windows 95/98/ME. <br />
<br />
<br />
Limitations: <br />
<br />
· Unregistered version does not permit copying CD/DVD objects for the purposes of recovering data - the program checks readability of CD/DVD files, but it can not save the files to the destination drive. To enable the full functionality you have to purchase the software and register your copy of CDRoller with the help of your license key. <br />
<br />
<br />
What's New in This Release: <br />
<br />
· Support of Windows XP Themes released. <br />
· New Side Bar similar to Microsoft Outlook offers an intuitive list of commands depending on the current situation (disc type, file system, data recovery problems, etc.). <br />
· Session Selector became more easy-to-use. All available sessions are visible in the main program window. Just tick a new item in the list of available sessions to select a new one. <br />
· Now the program window contains a built-in adviser with a basic recommendations for the beginners....</font></p></p>
