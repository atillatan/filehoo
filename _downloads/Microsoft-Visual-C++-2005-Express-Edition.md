<p><font size="2"><p>Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition enables you to write managedapplications for the .NET Framework that take advantage of the vastnumber of classes in the .NET Framework Class Library, includingfeatures such as garbage collection. <br />
<br />
The Visual C++ 2005 implements the new ECMA C++/CLI standard forwriting simple yet powerful code for the .NET Framework’.s CommonLanguage Runtime (CLR). Using Visual C++, you can write classlibraries, console applications, or Windows Forms applications. VisualC++ 2005 also lets you use C++ to build 32-bit native code consoleapplications that have access to the full Standard C and C++ libraries.You can also mix native and managed code in a single project, giving you the flexibilityto use existing libraries as well as .NET Framework classes in the sameapplication.<br />
<br />
Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition includes a fully ISO-compliantimplementation of the Standard Template Library (STL). STL is a generalpurpose library of algorithms and data structures that is based on aconcept known as generic programming. The library includes thecontainer classes—.such as vector, queue, list, and map—.that areimplemented using C++ templates. These work with any data type,including both built-in types as well as any types you define yourself.<br />
