<p><font size="2">EACis a new audio grabber for CD-ROM drives. The main differences towardsmost other audio grabbers : Low registration costs (just a postcard anda stamp), it works with a new technology, reading audio CDs almostperfectly. <br />
<br />
If there are any errors that can t be corrected, it will tell you onwhich time position the (possible) distortion occurred, so you couldeasily control it with e.g. the media player.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "Exact Audio Copy":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Usage of the Windows 95 and Windows NT ASPI Interface, so both SCSI and ATAPI CD-ROM drives are supported<br />
Hidden sector synchronization (jitter correction)<br />
Secure, fast and burst extraction methods selectable. Fast extractionshould run at the same speed as other grabbers, but is probably notexact anymore. Burst mode just grabs the audio data without anysynchronization.<br />
Read error and complete loss of sync detection and correction in secure modes, as far as possible <br />
Output of time positions of all non-exact corrections and listen to these positions<br />
Copy of ranges of music data, not only tracks<br />
Automatic Speed reduction on errors and fallback afterwards<br />
Normalization of extracted audio<br />
Usage of the Windows Audio Compression Manager (ACM Codecs) for direct compression e.g. to MP3 waves<br />

Support of external MP3, VQF, RA and AAC encoders for automatic compression after extraction<br />
Batch compression and decompression of/to WAV files<br />
Compression offset support for exact compression/decompression<br />
Detection of pre-track gaps<br />
Detection of silence in pre-track gaps<br />
Automatic creation of CUE sheets for CDRWin, including all gaps, indicies, track attributes, UPC and ISRC<br />
CD player functionality and prelistening to selected ranges<br />
Automatic detection of drive features, whether a drive has an accurate stream and/or does caching<br />
Sample Offsets for drives with no accurate streams, including the option of filling up missing samples with silence<br />
Option for synchronizing tracks for non-accurate stream drives<br />
Filename editing with local and remote CDDB database and cdplayer.ini support and more features like ID3 tagging<br />

<br />
<strong>Tips</strong><br />
==========<br />
<br />
Profiles from previous versions can not be used by this version of EAC.If you would like to import these, you need a side by side installationof the new EAC version and the older one. Load the settings in theolder one and exit the program. Then start the new EAC and save thatprofile.<br />
<br />
When installing EAC in a different directory than your old EAC, allyour CD information will be gone. To add the old information use the"Database / Import Database..." command and select the file in your oldEAC directory.<br />
<br />
It is possible that under Vista the WMA compression will not work, thisis due to restrictions in the scripting host. There are severalworkarounds, e.g. starting EAC with admin rights. </font></p>
