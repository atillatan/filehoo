<p><font size="2">The application was designed to protect your valuable data from partial or total loss by automating backup tasks, password protecting and compressing it to save storage space. <br />
<br />
The application is feature rich and offers an intuitive interface making all features easily accessible for both beginners and professionals.<br />
<br />
The application can perform all four backup types: full, incremental, differential and mirror. Using the wizard you can easily set up any backup configuration you wish.<br />
<br />
You can define powerful file filters </font></p>
<div style="clear: right; float: right; margin: 10px 0pt 10px 15px">&#160;</div>
<p><font size="2">and schedule your backups any way you want. Once a backup is performed, you can see what files changed since the last backup using the explorer-like tree view or you can read the statistics about the next backup execution. <br />
<br />
You can use the context menu from the tree to run standard actions associated with the file type. <br />
<br />
Backup4all creates standard zip files. This means that your data is not at the mercy of the utility itself; you can access it with any zip compatible utility. <br />
<br />
Backups larger than 2GB will be automatically split into more individual zip files, making them compatible with both WinZip and PKZip.<br />
<br />
Backup4all can perform incremental backup to keep track of file versions. You can easily restore any version of files or a whole folder. You can filter files to be restored. <br />
<br />
Backup4all works with any drive letter, including mapped network drives and UNC paths. The application comes with its own built-in CD burning support. <br />
<br />
Just set the destination on CD and execute the backup item. However, if you prefer, you can use UDF format (using products such as DirectCD or InCD).<br />
