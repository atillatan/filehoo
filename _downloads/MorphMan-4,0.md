<p><font size="2"><p>Morphman is a powerful tool for morphing pictures and videos.<br />
<br />
Morphman creates a sequence of intermediate frames that seamlesslytransform one image to another and generates output in a form of videoor image file sequence.<br />
<br />
MorphMan comes bundled with the full-featured video editor, completewith multitrack video and audio composition functions, dynamic effects,transitions, titling, color keying, and capture module which allows fordirect import of clips from DV cameras and other video capture hardware.<br />
