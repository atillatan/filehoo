<p><font size="2"><p>Repetitive Web surfing wastes a lot of time to individuals andcompanies. The Easy Bee aims to provide an user-friendly solution toWeb browsing costs. <br />
<br />
Indeed the product lets the user quickly and easily record web browsingmacros. It then replays them periodically and silently. Macros caninclude user actions such as form filling and button clicking, thusallowing the so-called invisible Web to be reached and included indashboard pages. <br />
<br />
The product also allows the user to specify an area to extract from target web pages such as an image or atable, letting users focus on their interests without being distractedby flashing advertisements and irrelevant links. The Easy Beeaggregates these extracts on pages that the user can easily edit byresizing and moving excerpts. Aggregated pages may be thought of asdashboards that always display up-to-date information. Dashboards areprinter-friendly and can be annotated before being printed. <br />
<br />
The graphical interface is designed to guide the user through thecreation of a new web agent in such a way that no technical knowledgeis required in order to record a browsing sequence, specify an area tocut out of the target page, indicate the refreshing schedule and designthe layout of dashboard pages. <br />
<br />
The product automatically locks all agents that operate onpassword-protected pages, hiding the gathered content and preventingagent edition. A global password chosen by the user is used to unlocksuch private content. Files related to private agents are encrypted onthe user disk with standard algorithms provided by Windows systems,preventing any malicious user to access private data.<br />
<br />
Altercept has chosen to hide the complexity of its underlyingproprietary technology with a nice metaphor: honeybees -web agents-diligently fly and gather their Web harvest in honeycombs -dashboards.<br />
