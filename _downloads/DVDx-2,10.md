<p><font size="2">DVDx allows you to convert DVD to VCD2.0 or SCVD1.0 or DivX in one step (Including multiplexing, splitting).<br />
<br />
DVDx has been designed especially for unexperimented users, it isa simple and intuitive program. You only need Nero to write yourVCD/SVCD. <br />
<br />
It produces good quality movies in MPEG1/2 format and you don t need to have 5GB or more free on your hard disk. <br />
<br />
DVDx produces high quality MPEG and AVI movies and advanced features provide smart settings for experimented users. <br />
<br />
<strong>Why is DVDx the fastest DVD backup solution out there ? </strong><br />
<br />
DVDx is likely the fastest solution ever to copy a DVD into a DivX file because the DVD reading (and decrypting) is done while encoding to DivX.<br />
<br />
Alternative solutions require to copy the DVD to the hard drive withDVD Decrypter (or SmartRipper or any other DVD ripping software) whichtakes about 30 minutes, and then the encoding time is added. So with a75FPS encoding speed for a 1:30 PAL (25FPS) movie, the total rippingtime of alternative software is 1 hour. While DVDx will take less than32 minutes (at 72FPS). <br />
<br />
We encourage you to upgrade your DivX codec to latest version whichtakes benefit from latest compiler enhancement for new Intel/AMDprocessors. On a $1,000 consumer HP Pavilion with a Intel Pentium 830D,the encoding DVDx frame rate is 72FPS with DivX Pro 6.1.1 and later.<br />
<br />
To encode to MPEG VCD/SVCD with the internal encoder or to encode toWindows Media, DVDx is also the fastest solution for the same reason. <br />
<br />
<span><strong>Requirements:</strong></span><br />
<br />
DirectX 8.1 or later (maybe 9.0 or later as of 2.4)<br />
A CDROM burning tool to write your VCD/SVCD (preferably Nero Burning Rom)<br />
Adaptec ASPI Driver 4.60 (recommended but not required)<br />
Eventually a DVD player (like WinDVD or PowerDVD)<br />

<font size="2"><strong>What s New</strong> in This Release:<br />
<br />
Third-party DLLs:<br />
- nLame.dll 3.97 Final (Intel 9.1 compile)<br />
- libmmd.dll 9.1 (Intel 9.1 compile)<br />
<br />
GUI enhancements:<br />
- Changed Open DVD root menu behavior, now display a Windows XP new syle<br />
file explorer dialog, initiliazed with last directory used by DVDx. Thus<br />
no longer annoying to change DVD drive for multiple drive computers or <br />
multiple DVDx ripped on hard drive.<br />
- Now display MPEG (VOB) file name without path in the MPEG2 file scanning<br />
progress window (required for long path current for DVDs ripped on hard drive).<br />
<br />
Packaging:<br />
- For some obscur reasons, my new compilation configuration failed to <br />
link Debug and DebugP4 object files because of their debugging data . <br />
so Debug and DebugP4 binaries bundled with 2.7Ultra Edition are 2.6 buil</font></div></p>
