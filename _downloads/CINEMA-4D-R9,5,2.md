Top quality made even better. Once again, CINEMA 4D convinces with its forward-looking innovation, ease of use and legendary stability. <br />
<br />
The actual release of CINEMA 4D offers you more possibilities than ever before, whether for film, television, advertising, scientific simulations, architecture, product design or any other field that demands professional results. Its one-of-a-kind modular system and the ease with which it can be learned make CINEMA 4D the ideal tool for any purpose and every budget <br />
<br />
The basic application already contains all functions needed to create high-end 3D images and animations – start the application and start working, it’s that easy. <br />
For those whose work demands more than the basic application, MAXON provides numerous CINEMA 4D modules that can be integrated seamlessly. <br />
<br />
A total of 10 modules are available with which you can expand the functionality of your CINEMA 4D application to fit your needs. You can save an extra 20%, compared with the individual purchase of modules, when you buy one of the available bundles. <br />
<br />
As a 3D artist you know that fast, easy workflow is the key to meeting deadlines and beating the competition. CINEMA 4D's interface takes advantage of non-modal managers for realtime feedback and robust OpenGL support to provide an efficient foundation, while allowing you to customize almost every aspect of the interface itself to achieve the fastest and easiest workflow possible. <br />
<br />
This version will give you the maximum space possible to work on your scenes or models. Little amenities have also been added that make working with CINEMA 4D more pleasant. For example, items can now be renamed directly in the Object Manager or Material Editor. <br />
<br />
CINEMA 4D's completely customizable interface puts every tool within easy reach. You can easily redesign layouts, palettes and even menus to match your personal workflow or particular tasks, and easily switch between layouts and menus with the click of a button. With cascading shortcuts, you can assign a shortcut key to any command and even group commands under a single shortcut. The global popup provides easy access to frequently used commands, while the HUD puts valuable scene data and tool options right on top of the scene. <br />
<br />
You're an artist, and it's important that your interface looks good in addition to working well. CINEMA 4D's schemes allow you to easily change the look and feel of the interface to match your style or mood. Use one of several included schemes or design your own and share it with other users. CINEMA 4D's fast, stylish interface fits you. You're a 3D artist in the real world, and it's time you start working faster - and smarter</font></p></p>
