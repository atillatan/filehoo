<br />
<span><strong>Here </strong><strong>are some key features of "Micro DVD Player":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Play Main Movie: The main movie may be any audio/video file typeplayable by the Windows Media Player (highly recommended is MPEG4 videoand MP3 audio due to great quality at low filesizes). <br />
"Emulate" original DVD Navigation Menu: To get the look-and-feel asclose to the DVD as possible, you can also rip the navigation menu ofthe DVD to video and still images and have MDVDP display it! <br />
Play Special Features: Often DVDs offer additional videos containing"making- of"s or similar background information. Those special featurevideos can also be included and played by MDVDP, usually they arereachable through certain click-areas in the nav menu. <br />
Display Subtitles: An important feature, especially when you watchforeign language movies, are subtitles if you don t understand all ofthe dialog. Micro DVD Player can display your ripped subtitles. <br />
