<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>VirtualDubis a video capture/processing utility for 32-bit Windows platforms(95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP), licensed under the GNU General Public License(GPL). <br />
<br />
It lacks the editing power of a general-purpose editor such as AdobePremiere, but is streamlined for fast linear operations over video. <br />
<br />
It has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers offiles and can be extended with third-party video filters.VirtualDub isa software that allows you to capture and process video files. <br />
<br />
VirtualDub is mainly geared toward processing AVI files, although itcan read (not write) MPEG-1 and also handle sets of BMP images.<br />
<br />
I basically started VirtualDub in college to do some quickcapture-and-encoding that I wanted done. from there it s basicallygrown into a more general utility that can trim and clean up videobefore exporting to tape or processing with another program. <br />
<br />
I released it on the web and others found it useful, so I ve beentinkering around with its code ever since. If you have the time, pleasedownload and enjoy.</p>
