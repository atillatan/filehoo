<p><font size="2"><p>Regmon is a Registry monitoring tool that will show you whichapplications are accessing your Registry, which keys they areaccessing, and the Registry data that they are reading and writing -all in real-time. <br />
<br />
This advanced utility takes you one step beyond what static Registrytools can do, to let you see and understand exactly how programs usethe Registry. With static tools you might be able to see what Registryvalues and keys changed.<br />
<br />
With Regmon you`ll see how the values and keys changed.<br />
<br />
<strong>Installation and Use</strong><br />
Install Regmon by copying the files to your hard drive, and start it by running Regmon.exe. Menu items and tool bar buttons can be used to toggle on and off monitoring, disableevent capturing, control the scrolling of the listview, and save thelistview contents to an ASCII file. <br />
<br />
Use the Filter dialog, which is accessed with a toolbar button or theOption|Filter/Highlight menu selection, to select what data will beshown in the list view. The * wildcard matches arbitrary strings, andthe filters are case-insensitive. Only matches shown in the includefilter, but that are not excluded with the exclude filter, aredisplayed. Use . to separate multiple strings in a filter (e.g."regmon.software"). <br />
<br />
For example, if the include filter is HKLM", and the exclude filter is"HKLMSoftware", all references to keys and values under HKLM, except tothose under HKLMSoftware will be monitored. <br />
<br />
Wildcards allow for complex pattern matching, making it possible tomatch specific Registry accesses by specific applications, for example.The include filter “.Winword*Windows”. would have Regmon only showaccesses by Microsoft Word to keys and values that include the word“.Windows”.. <br />
<br />
Use the highlight filter specify output that you want to havehighlighted in the listview output. Select highlighting colors withOptions|Highlight Colors. <br />
<br />
Regmon can either timestamp events or show the time elapsed from thelast time you cleared the output window (or since you started Regmon).The Options menu and the clock toolbar button let you toggle betweenthe two modes. The button on the toolbar shows the current mode with aclock or a stopwatch. When showing duration the Time field in theoutput shows the number of seconds it took for the underlying filesystem to service particular requests. <br />
<br />
When you see a Registry value or key in Regmon s output that you wantto edit, simply double click on the line that includes the reference(or use the Regedit toolbar button) and Regmon will take you directlyto the specific value usi</p></p></p>
