This means you can rip a single file, complete title set or main movie <br />
as is, or, even better, initiate IFO Parsing (default) and rip the exact selected ProGram Chain (PGC). <br />

cladDVD XP.NET includes all the extended options like 'Multi-Angles', detection of 'Mastering Errors', 'MacroVision' removal, 'Key-Search' intensities and 'Audio Stream' re-mapping. <br />
<br />
cladDVD XP.NET also includes a 'FrameServe' option giving direct control and execution of the DVD2AVI program (included) to aid in the process of converting to a DivX AVI or Video-CD by creating the 'D2V' and 'WAV' file. <br />
<br />
cladDVD XP.NET is a .NET application and is also for Windows XP ONLY. <br />
