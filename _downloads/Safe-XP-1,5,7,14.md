<br />
It allows you to take control of your PC. <br />
Make Windows to run faster and more secure. <br />
Protect your privacy and strength Internet protection. <br />

It does not need any DLL or another file(s). It is just a single "EXE" file: SafeXP.exe <br />
No installation necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe XP allows working with command line parameters now. It could behelpful if you use SafeXP in any network environment. Syntax forexecution from the command line is as follows: SafeXP.exe <configuration-file></configuration-file><br />
where <configuration-file></configuration-file>is the name of the previously saved file.<br />
<br />
Example: SafeXP c:safexpsafexp.dat<br />

c:safexpsafexp.dat. Then it will apply values into the running/calling <br />
workstation. After execution program will be closed automatically.<br />
<br />

(for instance) SafeXP.dat files to the Netlogon share to load your <br />
predefined Safe XP settings silently to every workstation which is <br />
connected to the network.<br />
<br />
The command-line parameter is optional. If no parameter is specified, <br />
the program will start normally.</p></p></p>
