<p><font size="2"><p>WinHexis in its core a universal hexadecimal editor, particularly helpful inthe realm of computer forensics, data recovery, low-level dataprocessing, and IT security. An advanced tool for everyday andemergency use: inspect and edit all kinds of files, recover deletedfiles or lost data from hard drives with corrupt file systems or fromdigital camera cards. <br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "WinHex":</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong>Drive cloning, drive imaging</strong><br />
to produce exact duplicates of disks/drives, e.g. to save the time fora full installation of the operating system and other software forseveral computers/disks of the same type, or to be able to restore arunning installation in case of data loss/screwed up Windows(restoration of a backup). Also for computer forensics specialists,since they need to work on a copy when searching for evidence on theobject disk. You can clone directly, or from an image file. Menu: Tools| Disk Tools | Clone Disk <br />
<br />
<strong>RAM editor</strong><br />
e.g. for debugging purposes (programming), for examining/manipulatingany running program and in particular computer games (cheating). Tools| RAM Editor <br />
<br />
<strong>Analyzing files</strong><br />
e.g. to determine the type of data recovered as lost cluster chains by ScanDisk or chkdsk. Examples. Tools | Analyze File<br />
<br />
<strong>Wiping confidential files or disks</strong><br />
...so no one (not even computer forensics specialists) will be able toretrieve them. To securely erase a file, use File Manager | DeleteIrreversibly. For disk wiping, open the disk with the disk editor anduse Edit | Fill Disk Sectors. E.g. fill with zero bytes (hexadecimalvalue 00) or random bytes. WinHex works in accordance with the standardoutlined in DoD 5220.22-M (for details, please see this white paper).Also see X-Ways Security. <br />
<br />
<strong>Wiping unused space and slack space</strong><br />
...either to close security leaks, to securely destroy previouslyexisting classified files that have been deleted in the traditional wayonly, or to minimize the size of your disk backups (like WinHex backupsor Norton Ghost backups), since initialized space can be compressed99%. On NTFS drives, WinHex will even offer to wipe all currentlyunused $Mft (Master File Table) file records, as they may still containnames and fragments of files previously stored in them. File slack canbe found in the unused end of the last cluster allocated to a file,which usually contains traces of previously existing files. Slack space- like everything else - is processed by WinHex very fast. Also seeX-Ways Security. <br />
<br />
<strong>ASCII - EBCDIC conversion</strong><br />
Allows to exchange text between mainframe computers and the PC in bothdirections. You may even tailor the character translation table inWinHex (ebcdic.dat) for your own needs. Edit | Convert <br />
<br />
<strong>Binary, Hex ASCII, Intel Hex, and Motorola S conversion</strong><br />
z. B. for (E)PROM programmers. Edit | Convert<br />
<br />
<strong>Unifying and dividing odd and even bytes/words</strong><br />
for (E)PROM programmers. File Manager | Unify/Dissect <br />
<br />
<strong>Conveniently editing data structure</strong><br />
using custom templates. Download a tutorial. View | Template Manager <br />
<br />
<strong>Splitting files that do not fit on a disk</strong><br />
File Manager | Split/Concatenate <br />
<br />
<strong>WinHex as a reconnaissance and learning tool</strong><br />
Are you sure Microsoft Word really discards previous states of yourdocument? You may be surprised to find text deleted long ago in your.doc files. Maybe text that you really do not wish to be seen by theperson you are going to pass the .doc file to? Discover what varioussoftware programs save in their files. Study unknown file formats andlearn how they work. Investigate e.g. how executable files arestructured and how they are loaded in RAM. The possibilities arepractically unlimited. <br />
<br />
<strong>Finding interesting values (e.g. the number of lives, ammunition, etc.) in saved game files</strong><br />
using the Combined Search or using the File Comparison utility, for later manipulation<br />
<br />
<strong>Manipulating saved game files</strong><br />
for any computer game, following existing instructions from cheat sites on the Internet or for developing your own cheats.<br />
<br />
<strong>Upgrading MP3 jukeboxes and Microsoft Xbox with larger hard drive</strong><br />
To upgrade, the new hard disk must be prepared first. This is where youneed WinHex. Instructions for Creative s Nomad MP3 jukebox, DAP jukeboxand Microsoft Xbox. You can also change the name of your Xbox. <br />
<br />
<strong>Manipulating text</strong><br />
...that one is not supposed to edit, e.g. in binary files. It is notconvenient, but possible to translate practically any software intoanother language by editing text in the executable files, e.g. if thesource code is not available (e.g. lost). Or you would like to edittext in files of a certain binary type that the native application doesnot let you modify. For instance, programmers may find their compilerautomatically creates a configuration file for their project whosefilename (application name + .cfg) conflicts with a file their ownsoftware uses. If your local laws and the license permit that, edit thecompiler s executable file such that it works without problems (e.g.with the filename extension “..cnf”.). <br />
<br />
<strong>Viewing and manipulating files that usually cannot be edited</strong><br />
because they are protected by Windows (e.g. the swap file, temporaryfiles of the Internet Explorer), using the disk editor. Tools | DiskEditor <br />
<br />
<strong>Viewing, editing, and repairing system areas</strong><br />
such as the Master Boot Record with its partition table and boot sectors. Tools | Disk Editor | Access button <br />
<br />
<strong>Hiding data or discovering hidden data</strong><br />
...e.g. behind the supposed end of .jpg files (steganography), or inunused parts of logical drives or physical disks. WinHex specificallysupports access to surplus sectors that are not in use by the operatingsystem because they do not add to an entire cluster or cylinder. <br />
<br />
<strong>Copy &amp;. Paste</strong><br />
Use copy &amp;. paste or copy &amp;. write (=overwrite) with files,disks, and RAM. You may freely copy from a disk and write the clipboardcontents to a disk, without regard to sector boundaries! <br />
<br />
<strong>Unlimited Undo</strong><br />
When editing, reverse any of your steps. Only restricted by available disk space. Edit | Undo <br />
<br />
<strong>Jump back and forward</strong><br />
WinHex keeps a history of your offset jumps, and lets you go back andforward in the chain, like an Internet browser does. Position |Back/Forward <br />
<br />
<strong>Scripting</strong><br />
Automated file editing using scripts, to accelerate recurring routinetasks or to carry out certain tasks on unattended remote computers. Theability to execute scripts other than the supplied sample scripts islimited to owners of a professional license. Scripts can be run fromthe Start Center or the command line. While a script is executed, youmay press Esc to abort. With its wider range of application, scriptingsupersedes the Routine feature known from previous WinHex versions.Find out more about scripts in the program help. <br />
<br />
<strong>API (Application Programming Interface)</strong><br />
Professional users may also make good use of WinHex advancedcapabilities in their own programs written in Delphi, C/C++, or VisualBasic. The WinHex API provides a convenient interface for random accessto files and disks (at the sector level). The provided functions aresimilar to the scripting commands. Details <br />
<br />
<strong>Data recovery</strong><br />
for erroneously deleted files or generally after an experienced loss ofdata. Can be done manually (see undeleting files) or automatically.There is an automatic recovery mode for FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, and NTFSdrives called “.File Recovery by Name”. that simply requires you tospecify one or more file masks (like *.gif, John*.doc, etc.). WinHexwill do the rest. Via the Access button menu, a recovery mechanism isavailable for FAT drives which re-creates entire nested directorystructures (details here). Another mechanism (“.File Recovery by Type”.,formerly “.file retrieval”.) can be used on any file system and recoversall files of a certain type at a time. Supported file types: jpg, png,gif, tif, bmp, dwg, psd, rtf, xml, html, eml, dbx, xls/doc, mdb, wpd,eps/ps, pdf, qdf, pwl, zip, rar, wav, avi, ram, rm, mpg, mpg, mov, asf,mid. In particular owners of digital cameras quite often encounterproblems with their media. WinHex is likely to help with this automatedfunction that makes good use of the existence of file headers(characteristic signatures at the beginning of a file).

<strong>Computer examination/forensics</strong><br />
WinHex is an invaluable tool in the hands of computer investigativespecialists in private enterprise and law enforcement. Details <br />

<strong>Trusted download (a security issue)</strong><br />
When transferring unclassified material from a classified hard diskdrive to unclassified media, you need to be certain that a copied filewill have no extraneous information in any cluster or sector “.overhang”.spuriously copied along with the actual file, since this slack spacemay still contain classified data from a time when it was allocated toa different file. The command Tools | Specialist Tools | Copy exactlycopies the file in its current size, no entire sectors or clusters. Notone byte beyond the end of the file will be copied to the destinationdisk. Minimize your IT risks. Requires a specialist license. <br />
