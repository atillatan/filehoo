<p><font size="2"><p>Specifically GIMPShop is a version of the GIMP that has been edited to be more user-friendly for Photoshop users.<br />
<br />
The terminology and menu structure are adapted to look and feel morelike Photoshop, and other adjustments were also made to make the GIMPmore usable. <br />
<br />
In the Windows version, the Deweirdifyer Plugin has been used to placeall of the various windows into one nesting window, so it will act morelike a single program that multiple little programs.. <br />
<br />
Also the menu structure and terminology are adapted to to look and feel more like Photoshop.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> To make the Photoshop shortcuts work you have to startGIMPshop once (to create the .gimp-2.2 user dir). Then close it and runthe pskeys.bat from the install dir or run the link in the star</p></p></p>
