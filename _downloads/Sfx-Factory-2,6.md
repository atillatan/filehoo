<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">There is no doubt about it: the transfer of files over the internet isalready an unrenounceable means of data distribution and will becomemore and more important in the near future.<br />
<br />
Compression tools, like WinAce, are a great help when it comes tocrunching program or data files into much smaller packages, saving diskspace and - much more important these days - valuable download time andserver bandwidth.<br />
<br />
But what if the person on the other end of the line does not have immediate access to your compressed file? <br />
<br />
What if there is no free extractor like XAce Plus installed on your notebook or on your customers workstation you just downloaded your company s profile presentation or the important product demo to?<br />
<br />
For these and other everyday occasions, self-extracting files are yourbest option to avoid moments of embarrassment and spontaneous internetsessions in order to find "that damn extraction tool" you need sodesperately to get on with your work now.<br />
<br />
SFX files ideally bring a good compression ratio to keep your filepackages as small and compact as possible. Due to their built-inextraction capability, you will be totally independent from any otherdecompression tools - there does not need to be an extrction orcompression tool installed on your targeted computer system at all. Inorder to keep your SFX files small, this extraction code also needs tobe lean and efficient.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "Sfx Factory":</strong></span><br />
<br />
built-in compression for ZIP and - for even smaller installation files - ACE <br />
project files that store your default settings for recurrent tasks <br />

3 different SFX installation types (Basic, Advanced, Expert) <br />
extremely small data overheads for each installation type <br />
multilingual support - create your SFX files in english, french or german (more to follow) <br />
a generic uninstaller that ships with Sfx-Factory (or add your own uninstall package) <br />
windows registry modification - add or edit registry keys and values <br />
user defined title screens (text and/or graphic fileswith over 20 transition effects <br />
display of a licence agreement which requires to be confirmed prior to the installation process <br />
execution a program automatically after installation has finished <br />
