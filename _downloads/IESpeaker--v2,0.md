<p><font size="2"><p>IESpeaker is a great solution to browse faster than before.<br />
<br />
Let IE speak the current webpage for you so you dont have to read them. Audio and video together have a better impact than only one of them. <br />
<br />
Just select some piece of text on webpage, right click, click on speak menu and let it speak for you.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note for Win2K users</strong><br />
Please do not overwrite any files <br />
while installation of the engine. Always select never overwrite option</p></p></p>
