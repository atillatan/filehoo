<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>Symantec Security Response has developed a removal tool to clean the following infections: W32.Evaman.C@mm.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important:</strong> If you are on a network or have a full-time connection to the Internet, such as a DSL or cable modem, disconnect the computer from the network and Internet. <br />
<br />
Disable or password-protect file sharing, or set the shared files toRead Only, before reconnecting the computers to the network or to theInternet. Because this worm spreads by using shared folders onnetworked computers, to ensure that the worm does not re-infect thecomputer after it has been removed, Symantec suggests sharing with ReadOnly access or by using password protection.<br />
<br />
The W32.Evaman.C@mm Removal Tool does the following: <br />
<br />
- Terminates the W32.Evaman.C@mm processes <br />
- Deletes theW32.Evaman.C@mm files <br />
- Deletes the registry values that theW32.Evaman.C@mm added</p></p></p>
