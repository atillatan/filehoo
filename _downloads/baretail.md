description: >-
  Baretail is a small FREE program like a tail in UNIX
  It is much more useful than even the UNIX tail -f because you can have several tiled windows open at once, and you can pause updates while looking closely at the file. Very large files are supported (over 2 GB) and  highlighting is available to make errors easier to spot in log files.
