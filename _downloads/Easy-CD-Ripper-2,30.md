<p><font size="2">EasyCd Ripper makes use of a variety of encoders to convert audio tracksinto MP3, WMA, WAV and VQF. The program can connect to the CDDBdatabase for fast file naming and ID3 tagging.<br />
<br />
The layout on Easy CD Ripper is very nice, everything you need right infront of you. You can easily change the output folder, bitrate options,file format, and artist info right from the main screen. <br />
<br />
The ripper and LAME encoder combo worked very quickly on the fly andproduced a nice sounding file at 128kbps. It even did OK with a trackon a scratched CD. If you have WAV files already on your system, Easy CD Ripperhas a WAV converter you can load them into and pump out MP3, VQF, orWMA files just like you can from a CD.<br />
<br />
You get many file format options and the program works quickly. Therewere few drawbacks on the whole and no major problems I could find.<br />
