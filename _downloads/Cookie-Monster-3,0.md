Cookie Monster is a manager for cookies created by the most usual Windows browsers: Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, Netscape and Opera (only basic support for this one). <br />
<br />
It also works with any Gecko-based browser and most of the browsers based in Internet Explorer. The program allows you set a list of the cookies you want to preserve and then delete the remaining ones with a simple mouse click. It also have the option of detecting the cookies for the sites included in your favorites and/or bookmarks. <br />
<br />
Useful <br />
for people who cares about his privacy but don't want to disable or block all the cookies (a lot of pages need them to work properly). <br />
<br />
This software is freeware, but only for PERSONAL AND NON-PROFIT USE. For commercial, corporate, educational or government use, or inclusion in any distribution made for profit (software compilations, CD's...) you must contact the author for authorization. <br />
<br />
Depending on the browser and version of Windows used, Cookie Monster will detect different sets of cookies: <br />
<br />
- In Windows 9x/Me the program usually detects all the cookies at the same time. <br />
- In Windows 2000/XP the behaviour vary according to the browser: <br />
- Internet Explorer: The program only detects the cookies of the current Windows user. <br />
- Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape 7: The program detects the cookies in all the profiles of the current Windows user. <br />
- Opera: Opera uses a single cookie file in old versions and a file for the cookies of each Windows user in recent versions (7 and up). Both situations are detected by the program. <br />
- Netscape 4.x: The program detects the cookie files of every profile. <br />
- Other Gecko-based browsers: the program will detect the cookies for all the profiles stored in the folder selected by the user. <br />
<br />
Note that session cookies are not saved in any file (since they only exists until the browser is closed), and thus they won't be detected. <br />
<br />
What's New in This Release: <br />
<br />
Â· Added system tray icon, Added options for exporting and importing the preserved cookies list <br />
