<p><font size="2">PassMarkDiskCheckup allows the user to monitor the SMART attributes of aparticular hard disk drive. SMART ( Self Monitoring Analysis &amp;.Reporting Technology ) is an interface between a computer s BIOS (basicinput/output system) and the computer hard disk. <br />
<br />
It is a feature of the Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE)technology that controls access to the hard drive. If S.M.A.R.T isenabled when a computer is set up, the BIOS can receive analytical information from the hard drive anddetermine whether to send the user a warning message about possiblefuture failure of the hard drive.<br />
<br />
SMART monitors elements of possible long term drive failure, such as Spin Up Time , the number of start/stops, the number of hours poweredon and the temperature.<br />
<br />
DiskCheckup displays the current values of the SMART attributes, alongwith the Threshold value for that attribute. If any attribute value isclose to or below the threshold, the drive is no longer reliable andshould be replaced.<br />
<br />
Note that SMART attributes change slowly over time and are helpful when diagnosing the life span of a particular drive.<br />
<br />
DiskCheckup will display some additional drive information, such as thedrive serial number, tracks, the number of cylinders, model number, thesectors pe</font></p></p>
