<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">Checks your source drive and tells you which files are corrupted <br />
CDCheck is utility for prevention, detection and recovery of damaged files with emphasis on error detection. CDCheck does support DVDs! <br />
<br />
It supports CRC files and binary compare. CDCheck can be used on all files visible by your OS which means all files that you can see in Windows Explorer (CDs, floppy disks, disk drives, ZIP drives...). <br />
<br />
CDCheck can be used freely for personal, educational use as long as you are not making any money with data being CRCed, checked or recovered. <br />
<br />
You do not need any registration code for this use since CDCheck has no limitations built in (is <br />
fully functional). You are however encouraged to support further development by buying support license (or even single license). <br />
<br />
Here are some key features of "CDCheck": <br />
<br />
· hash creation and checking <br />
· file/directory checking <br />
· binary file/directory compare <br />
· file/directory recovery <br />
· audio CD support <br />
· data DVD support <br />
· CD/DVD information with media ratings <br />
<br />
<br />
CDCheck does not provide: <br />
<br />
· recovery of files that cannot be seen by Windows Explorer <br />
(audio CD recovery is possible but not recommended) <br />
· recovery of deleted files (from disk, floppy drive...) <br />
<br />
CDCheck reporting features tell you exactly where the problems are. Files on CDs, zip drives, USB keys etc. can get damaged in a number of ways, so the program helps you determine whether your data is safe before it's too late. <br />
<br />
The program also provides extremly fast binary compare for effectively checking that file transfers (burning, copying...) were accomplished successfully and alerts you of differences. Besides that CDCheck supports creation and checking of MD5, CRC-32, SHA... hashes in SFV, MD5 and CRC file formats. <br />
<br />
This provides means to check backups for possible loss of information or verify file transfers where comparing is not possible (transfer over mail etc.). The program can be used with all local or removable media (CDs, DVDs, disk drives, floppy disks, ZIP drives, USB keys...) visible by the operating system (Windows Explorer) and also with audio CDs. <br />
<br />
In addition CDCheck also gives detailed information (manufacturer, type, capacity...) about inserted CD or DVD media. <br />
<br />
Limitations: <br />
<br />
· For personal usage CDCheck is FREE <br />
· Unregistered program continues to function after 30 days but a nag screen is displayed at startup. <br />
<br />
<br />
What's New in This Release: <br />
<br />
· Recovery process can now be terminated or paused between retries of reading a sector <br />
· ';' character now valid as comment character for .md5 files <br />
· disc label showing fixed on DVR-A08 and maybe some other devices when using CDChek eject/load function <br />
· faster displaying of CDInfo <br />
· small fix in ISO compliance</font></p></p>
