<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>Toolbarcop is a small software application that can be used toeliminate malware toolbands, browser helper objects and toolbar iconsin Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
A BHO is a COM in-process server registered under a certain registrykey. Upon startup, Internet Explorer looks up that key and loads allthe objects whose CLSID is stored there. <br />
<br />
Most of the Internet Explorer crashes are due to malware browser helperobjects. Though you can disable "Third-party Extensions" in the Advanced Tab of Internet Explorer, this is just a *workaround*. <br />
<br />
If you have three BHOs, one of which is the needed one and the othertwo are spyware BHOs. What if you want your favorite BHO running anddisable the other two BHOs?<br />
<br />
You can disable/delete a particular BHO using ToolbarCop s "BROWSER HELPER OBJECT" section. <br />
<br />
Select a BHO and see the "Description" and "Related File". The "Related File" is the in-process server [DLL]. <br />
<br />
Select the unwanted item from the list and Disable it. If Windowsfunctions normally without that BHO, you can safely delete that BHOlater.<br />
<br />
<span class="articleDetailsLink"><strong>Can disable or eliminate the following browser add-ons selectively from Internet Explorer:</strong></span><br />
<br />
Unwanted Browser Helper Objects (BHO) <br />
Toolbars (Tool Band) <br />
Standard Toolbar buttons <br />
Context menu Extensions <br />
Third-party download managers &amp;. <br />
Third-party Protocol Handlers and their residual entries remaining in the registry. <br />
Horizontal / Vertical Explorer Bars (side-search bars)<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> This utility can be used as a Quick-Solution to removeToolbar, Toolbar icons, and BHOs. But, this cannot be substituted witha spyware remover utility. Still, I strongly recommend you use aspyware remover like Ad-Aware</a>.</p></p></p>
