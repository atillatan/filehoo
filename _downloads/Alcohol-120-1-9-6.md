Alcohol 120% - DVD/CD burning and emulation software <br />
Alcohol 120% is the CD &amp; DVD emulation and recording program that will allow users to easily copy a visible and an invisible disc. <br />
<br />
Alcohol 120% enables users to create 31 virtual CD &amp; DVD-ROM to play discs without needing a physical disc, it also enables users to copy CD &amp; DVD to CD-R / CD-RW / DVD-R / DVD-RW / DVD-RAM / DVD+RW. Alcohol 120% combines all functions of Alcohol 52% (CD &amp; DVD emulation software). <br />
<br />
Alcohol brings a new meaning to the word multimedia! It is without a doubt a leader in its class, bringing the ability to emulate and record CDs and DVDs together into one amazingly easy to use software program. <br />
<br />
Using the latest technology the program is constantly being developed and improved to add new features, allowing it to maintain it's position as a leading software package. <br />
<br />
Imagine being able to store your most used CDs as images on your computer and just call them up at the click of a button! And then run them at 200x the speed of some CD drives and without requiring the CD itself! How about being able to make a backup of that CD onto another CD either using the CD itself or just using the image you have created? This is what Alcohol allows you to do and much more. <br />
<br />
Alcohol 120% enables you to make a duplicate back-up to recordable media of nearly all your expensive Game/Software/DVD titles, and/or an image that can be mounted and run from any one of Alcohol's virtual drives. <br />
<br />
No other software available enables you to create up to a staggering 31 virtual drives, allowing you to <br />
run your game images at over 200x faster than from a conventional CD-ROM. Alcohol 120% is a powerful utility that uses a unique combination of options to ensure a perfect back-up every time. <br />
<br />
All you need is a PC combined with a CD or a DVD burner. No more replacing your expensive original discs due to loss, theft, scratches, or other media imperfections. Your duplicate works just like the original; your entire collection can be archived and your investment protected. <br />
<br />
