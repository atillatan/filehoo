<p><font size="2"><p>WindowBlindsis a program that allows you to completely change the look and feel ofWindows to however you want it to look like. <br />
<br />
WindowBlinds allows you to completely customize your desktop look bychanging the style of title buttons, bars and toolbars. You can changethe look of buttons and check boxes by assigning them skins, orpersonalities, and you can assign buttons that will launch programs totoolbars. <br />
<br />
You can create your own skins, choose from the four that are includedin the program, or download additional ones. You can also choose toexclude certain programs from WindowBlinds if you don`t want to changetheir appearances.<br />
<br />
Applying visual styles : In addition to the shortcut to theWindowBlinds Advanced Config window in your Start menu, you can changeWB visual styles and settings from either the Skins or Appearance tabin Display Properties.<br />
<br />
Set the skin to Windows Classic to not use a WB skin on startup (or usethe options on the Skins tab or in the Advanced Config window).<br />
<br />
Be sure to check out www.WinCustomize.com to select from over 3200 free visual styles.<br />
<br />
WindowBlinds has been designed and tested to be as compatible with withthousands of applications and pieces of hardware available. Its memoryload is quite low (unless you are using complex skins with lots ofanimation) and any oddities with specific apps can generally be workedaround quickly (see the Troubleshooting section of the online help filefor more information).<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "WindowBlinds":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Excellent application compatibility. Because Stardock has had yearsto tune WindowBlinds for compatibility, WindowBlinds has excellentcompatibility. How good? Ask Microsoft, Nintendo, nVidia, ATI, and manyothers who have licensed WindowBlinds to release additional visualstyles.<br />
Top Notch Performance. WindowBlinds uses the graphics acceleration features of today s video cards to accelerate visual styles.<br />
Tight Integration. WindowBlinds is so tightly integrated into WindowsXP (and Windows 2000) it can even skin the Windows command prompt. OnlyWindowBlinds makes this possible.<br />
Native. WindowBlinds doesn t "skin" over the Windows GUI. Instead, itactually handles the painting for the application. This allowsWindowBlinds to skin virtually every control. On Windows XP, forexample, WindowBlinds can actually stylize more controls on moreprograms than the bundled msstyle engine<br />
WindowBlinds 4 also now skins virtually every aspect of the WindowsGUI that one can imagine. And in fact, the enhanced visual styles usedby WindowBlinds can skin things previously not thought to be skinnablesuch as logon/logoff dialogs, the "please wait" dialog, backgrounds inthe Control Panel and other special folders, and more.<br />
WindowBlinds also comes with clean and easy configuration dialog.Users can still control their WindowBlinds enhanced visual styles fromthe display properties dialog, but the WindowBlinds configuration makesit easy to manage dozens of skins, sort them by category, and configureit to their liking.<br />
WindowBlinds gives Windows XP users, for the first time, a say on howbig their Windows XP start bar is. Now users can set how big they wanttheir Start bar to be.<br />
WindowBlinds visual styles support skinning additional small aspectsof the Windows XP user interface such as mouse-overs on the Start menu.<br />
WindowBlinds supports a feature called "Hyperpaint". This isdifferent from "Smart Paint". Hyperpaint uses the extra video RAM onyour video card to "buffer" your windows which makes moving them onscreen possible without any repainting.<br />
WindowBlinds lets users define what double clicking and rightclicking on the title bar do. This can translate into significantproductivity gains for users as they can perform various actions with asingle or double click to the title bar.<br />
Stardock Skincast is a way for users to add new visual styles toWindows right from the appearance dialog or WB Configuration dialog. Itautomatically downloads the week s featured visual style and installsit.<br />
WindowBlinds can change the color of any visual style on the fly.While there are thousands of existing WindowBlinds visual styles, thisfeature allows users to take those visual styles and tune them to theirown tastes visually. The same is true about gamma adjustment and evengray scale. A user can even invert the colors of a visual style. <br />
WindowBlinds allows users to have different visual styles on different applications.<br />
WindowBlinds can skin non-theme aware applications. Windows XP isdesigned to only fully skin "theme aware" programs. But WindowBlinds 4can skin even non-theme aware applications fully while stillmaintaining a high level of compatibility.<br />
WindowBlinds enables users to change the Windows progress animationsto one of their choice. Users can even mix and match their visualstyles and their animations.<br />
WindowBlinds can change the toolbar icons of Internet Explorer and Explorer.<br />
