<p><font size="2"><p>Terragen 2 is now the primary development focus of Planetside Software. <br />
<br />
Apart from being a much more powerful renderer, TG2 has a much moreflexible architecture which will allow development to proceed at aconsiderably greater pace.<br />
<br />
Terragen 2 features an advanced hybrid micropolygon renderer with powerful multi-angle displacement capabilities.<br />
<br />
It provides a versatile procedural engine that can be utilised toapply subpixel-level detail to almost any aspect of a scene. Terragen 2is capable of rendering billions of polygons in a single scene. <br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "Terragen":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Cutting-edge adaptive subdivision renderer. <br />
Modular, plugin-based architecture. <br />
Render entire planets, sweeping vistas, tiny rock gardens, or anything in between. <br />
Import 3D objects for rendering. Export high resolution objects. <br />
Render millions of boulders or trees using "instancing". <br />
Add multiple heightfields to your scene. Use procedural terrains that can span an entire planet. <br />
Apply almost "infinite" fractal detail to terrain and other objects. <br />
Overhanging terrain using procedural displacements, image-based displacements, or imported geometry. <br />
Volumetric clouds or fast "2.5D" clouds. <br />
Production quality anti-aliasing and motion blur. <br />
Node graph editor for ultimate control over shaders and textures.</p></p></p>
