<p><font size="2"><p>XviD is a video codec just like DivX. <br />
Most new movies and videos are being encoded with XviD.<br />
<br />
The XviD Codec is needed to play movies encoded by XviD. <br />
XviD is better than DivX.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "Koepi XviD":</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
I, P Frame encoding, PMVFast and EPZS with diamond and square patternmotion estimation, inter4v mode, fullpixell and halfpixel, precision,both MPEG4 and H263 quantizations, custom quant matrices, Adaptivequantization / Luminance masking.<br />
<br />
XviD is a continuation of Project Mayo and aims to develope a high quality open-source MPEG-4 codec. <br />
<br />
As you may already know, XviD comes from the same open-source projectthat was the basis for DivX 4.x/5.x, but instead of going allcommercial, XviD remains open-source. The quality of the codec isextremely good, and encoding speed is very fast as well, so it is atleast worth a try. </p>
