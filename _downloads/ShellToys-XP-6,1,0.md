<strong>What s New</strong> in This Release:<br />
<br />
The ShellToys XP Settings window has had a major redesign, along withvarying levels of cosmetic overhaul throughout ShellToys XP.<br />
As part of the redesign, ShellToys XP has edged away from Windows98/Me/2000 users. Although still compatible with 98/Me/2000, the visualdesign now assumes a true-color display and support for alpha-blendedicons used in Windows XP/Server 2003/Vista. Some aspects of ShellToysXP may therefore look poor on older Windows versions.<br />
In addition to disabling unwanted ShellToys XP menu tools or movingfavorite tools to the main context menu, the Configure Menu Items pageof the ShellToys XP Settings window now allows the items to bedisplayed in any order, and separators to be added to the menus.<br />
For users of Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003/Vista, the Personal Folderused to store user-specific settings for ShellToys XP is now created inthe Application Data folder. When upgrading from an earlier version ofShellToys XP, the installer moves files from the original location ofthe Personal Folder (within the ShellToys XP installation folder) tothis new folder.<br />
New Dialogs+ provides easy management of file dialogs (includingMicrosoft Office dialogs), letting you choose the size and view-styleof Open/Save dialogs when they appear. Dialogs+ also adds a handytoolbar menu containing folders on your Go To Folder list for easyfolder navigation in dialogs.<br />
The desktop icon position saver is no longer built into the ControlPanel s Display Properties window. Instead a new Desktop IconPositions item is shown on the context menu when you right-click ablank space on the desktop.<br />
The desktop icon position saver now includes options to managedesktop-icon layouts: you can duplicate, rename and delete saved iconlayouts.<br />
Extended Delete now includes a negative mask option, allowing you find files that don t match the specified file mask.<br />
Extended Search &amp;. Replace also allows you to search for files that don t match the specified file mask.<br />
Improves the loading-speed and quality of image thumbnails in Browse Media.<br />
Improves the quality of image thumbnails shown on the context menu in Image Size.<br />
You can now reach ShellToys XP s Image Editor directly from the ImageSize tool by holding the Ctrl key when clicking the Image Sizecontext-menu item (or the image-preview on the menu).<br />
Browse Media now has a Details tab showing file and EXIF information (if available) for the selected image.<br />
The View Icons window now includes a Browser panel which will findand list all icon files and icon-libraries (such as .exe and .dllfiles) in the selected folder. Click a filename to view the icons itcontains.<br />
The View Icons tool is now available for folders and the folderbackground, allowing you to browse a folder for icons and iconlibraries.<br />
The Properties dialog in View Icons now includes Save As and Custom Export buttons, giving a quick way to save an icon.<br />
Print Folder Listing has been entirely rewritten to produce improvedoutput and provide more options. Printed output is now HTML-based(requiring Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher) and can include file icons.Contents listings and tree structures can also be copied to theclipboard in ASCII or RTF formats, or saved as ASCII, RTF or MHTMLfiles.<br />
Encrypt File now includes an option to create a self-decrypting file,making it possible to distribute encrypted files to non-ShellToys XPusers.<br />
The Duplicate File tool now allows more than one copy of the selected file or folder to be created.<br />
In Batch Rename, when using the Construct Sequence tab to create analphanumeric sequence of filenames, a new Sort menu allows the selectedfiles to be easily sorted by name, date or size before renaming them.<br />
In Play Media Album you can now drag-and-drop a folder into the window to play the audio files it contains.<br />
The video player used in Browse Media and Media Info now supportsforward/rewind: hold PageDown to scroll forward or PageUp to scrollbackward. combine with the Ctrl key for faster winding. You can usethese keys while the movie is playing or paused.<br />
In Media Info, the player window for audio and video files allows youto drag-and-drop multiple files into the window, to play themsequentially in alphabetical order.<br />
In New From Template, when you create a new file from a template andwant to open it for editing straight away, you can now choose whichapplication to use from a list of compatible programs.<br />
The Reminders feature of Clock+ now allows you to set reminders to occur monthly or annually at the same date and time.<br />
The Clock+ calendar now adjusts its colors according to whether the blue, silver or olive XP theme is used.<br />
Fixes a bug that prevented the Duplicate Folder tool from being detached and shown on the main context menu.<br />
Fixes a bug that caused an exception if Copy Path or Shortcut Targetwere used and the options to resolve mapped network drives wereselected on the Menu &amp;. Tool Options page of the ShellToys XPcontrol panel.<br />
Improves support for Windows Vista (based on Vista Ultimate build5384). The majority of ShellToys XP tools and features can be used inthis build of Windows Vista, but we don t claim full compatibility withVista.<br />
Numerous other improvements and a few minor bug-fixes....</div></p></p>
