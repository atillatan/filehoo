<p><font size="2">Filemonwill monitor and display file system activity on a system in real-time.Its advanced capabilities make it a powerful tool for exploring the wayWindows works, seeing how applications use the files and DLLs, ortracking down problems in system or application file configurations. <br />
<br />
Filemon`s timestamping feature will show you precisely when every open,read, write or delete, happens, and its status column tells you theoutcome.<br />
<br />
Filemon is so easy to use that you`ll be an expert within minutes. Itbegins monitoring when you start it, and its output window can be savedto a file for off-line viewing. It has full search capability, and ifyou find that you`re getting information overload, simply set up one ormore filters. <br />
<br />
Filemon works on NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows XP 64-bitEdition, Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME. Sysinternals also has aversion of Filemon for Linux.<br />
<br />
<strong>Installation and Use</strong> Simply run FileMon (filemon.exe). You musthave administrator privilege to run FileMon. When FileMon is startedfor the first time it will monitor all local hard drives. Menus, hot-keys, ortoolbar buttons can be used to clear the window, select and deselectmonitored volumes including network volumes (Windows NT/2K/XP), savethe monitored data to a file, and to filter and search output. <br />
<br />
If you ve specified filters then FileMon will ask you to confirmfilters used from the last session each time you start it. To startFileMon without it prompting you specify the /q switch on the commandline. When FileMon starts it automatically captures file systemactivity. To start it with capture disabled use the /o switch on thecommand-line. <br />
<br />
As events are printed to the output, they are tagged with a sequencenumber. If Filemon’.s internal buffers are overflowed during extremelyheavy activity, this will be reflected with gaps in the sequencenumber. <br />
<br />
Each time you exit FileMon it remembers the filters you ve configured,position of the window and the widths of the output columns. <br />
<br />
<strong>Filtering</strong> Use the Filter dialog, which is accessed with atoolbar button or the Edit|Filter/Highlight menu selection, to selectwhat data will be shown in the list view. The * wildcard matchesarbitrary strings, and the filters are case-insensitive. Only matchesshown in the include filter, but that are not excluded with the excludefilter, are displayed. Use . to separate multiple strings in a filter(e.g. "filemon.temp"). Windows NT/2000 note: because of theasynchronous nature of file I/O, its not possible to filter on theresult field. <br />
<br />
Wildcards allow for complex pattern matching, making it possible tomatch specific file accesses by specific applications, for example. Theinclude filter “.Winword*Windows”. would have FileMon only show accessesby Microsoft Word to files and directories that include the word“.Windows”.. <br />
<br />
Use the highlight filter specify output that you want to havehighlighted in the listview output. Select highlighting colors withEdit|Highlight Colors. <br />
<br />
Additional filter options select or deselect read, write or openoperations. In many troubleshooting scenarios only open operations areof interest,</font></p></p>
