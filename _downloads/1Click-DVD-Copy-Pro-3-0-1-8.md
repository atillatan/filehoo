<p><font size="2">1CLICK DVD COPY - PRO is a fast, easy-to-use, full featured software for copying DVD movies onto DVD discs. If the source DVD is larger than 4.7 GB (which is usually the case with Hollywood movies), it can compress the contents so that they fit onto a blank DVD disc without any noticeable loss of quality. You now have complete control over the final copy. Use the Copy Presetsâ„¢ or the more advanced features to select what content will be copied and how much compression will be used. With 1CLICK DVD COPY - PRO, you can make a perfect copy with just one click. </font></p>
