<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">CDmage is a software utility, which performs different tasks with acommon CD image files on your harddrive. The most-wanted being:scanning, repairing and extracting. <br />
<br />
<strong>Image scanning </strong><br />
A: It checks sectors against corruption. There are rules defined by ISOstandards, which must be followed by each sector of the CD. Otherprograms can perform similar checks as well, namely well knownBINChunker and Fireburner. CDmage displays all corrupted sectors alongwith a description of each error found. <br />
<br />
<strong>Image errors</strong><br />
CDmage can repair image errors, but not all errors can be repaired.CDmage uses a similar mechanism for repair as CD writer/reader does. Ituses Error Correction Code fields (ECCP&amp;.ECCQ) of the sectors. <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Safety of repairing corrupted sectors with CDmage </strong><br />
The repairing of corrupted sectors is 100% safe if corruption isn t intentional. Repaired sector is exactly like it soriginal. Please note than not all image errors should be repaired.There are intentinal errors which are part of some copy protectionschemes. Some CD ripping apps (CloneCD, BlindRead...) let you makeworking copy of your legally owned software. If copied software is copyprotected, then it s image files can contain intentional corruptions.Repairing of them would cause a non-working copy when burned. <br />
