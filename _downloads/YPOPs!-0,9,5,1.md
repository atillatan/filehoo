<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>YPOPs! is a Windows, Linux, Solaris and Mac program providing POP3 access to Yahoo! Mail.<br />
<br />
Yahoo! Mail disabled free access to its POP3 service in April 2002.This resulted in many people (including myself) to look for alternativefree POP3 services. <br />
<br />
But this exercise can be very difficult because of the fact that yourYahoo! Mail address could be with several people and informing all ofthem about your new email</a> address could prove to be a nightmare. <br />
<br />
This application emulates a POP3 server and enables popular emailclients like Outlook, Netscape, Eudora, Mozilla, Calypso, etc., todownload email from Yahoo! accounts. <br />
<br />
We do not go against the license agreements of Yahoo! Mail. Thisapplication is completely legitimate and well within the realms oflegal software. </p>
