<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>Net Transport is a fast and powerful download tool. <br />
You may use it to download files from Internet servers. <br />
<br />
Net Transport supports the most pop Internet protocols, including:<br />
HTTP / HTTPS <br />
FTP / through SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) <br />
MMS (Microsoft Media Services) <br />
RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) <br />
PNM (rename PNM to RTSP) <br />
BitTorrent <br />
<br />
Net Transport can use multiple threads to download files so if awebsite allows multithreaded downloads, much faster speeds can beexpected. <br />
<br />
This is especially effective for MMS streams because they use a fixedtransmission speed and loading several streams of the same file fullyuses your Internet bandwidth.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "Net Transport":</strong></span><br />
<br />
You can use the simple, but powerful "File Manager" to categorize and manage downloaded files more efficiently. <br />
Simple multi-user management. You can maintain several databases by logging on Windows with different username. <br />
You can use the inbuilt "Site Explorer" to list the directory structure of the remote server, and easily select the desired files. FTP is the most powerful item in NetXfer. <br />
FTP reuse mechanism allows you to use one connection to get differentfiles from the same site. If you like, you can use accessory FTP clienttool called "FTP Transport (FtpXfer)". <br />
The "Multiple Proxies mode" allows you to assign every working threada different proxy to break certain site restrictions, like only oneconnection per IP. <br />
Proxies with NTLM authentication can penetrate local firewall, like Microsoft ISA 2000. <br />
You can adjust the bandwidth usage of Net Transport to ensure surf at the same time. <br />
Monitor browser click. And you can add links through InternetExplorer extended context menu, or drag links to the "drop zone"window, etc. <br />
Net Transport can automatically shutdown the system or hang up the modem once all downloads are completed. <br />
Multilingual support for the user interface. I will be glad if you help me localize NetXfer. <br />
NTLM authentication is supported for both MMS and RTSP. In addition, RN5 authentication works for RTSP. <br />
You can use multi-threads for both MMS and RTSP to significantly reduce the time of downloads. <br />
Automatically parse streaming script such as .asx, .smi to acquire real URLs. <br />
Support SSL encryption for both HTTP and FTP, which is called httpsand ftps. Also support one-time password to protect your authenticationinformation. Normally password is in the form of clear text, which iseasily stolen by IP packet monitor tools. Presently NetXfer is the onlyone can download https streaming via SOCKS5. <br />
Support SSH encryption, which is hardly found in other upload/download tools for Windows. <br />
The flexible "Scheduler Manager" is also most powerful item inNetXfer. Even you can record the dynamic URL according to time and saveit as your desire filename. <br />
In version 2, you can record the clip with range. <br />
On BitTorrent protocol, you can use proxy to download, upload by UPnP. NetXfer supports HTTP/HTTPS/UDP Tracker. <br />
