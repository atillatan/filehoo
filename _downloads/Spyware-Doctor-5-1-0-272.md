<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">Spyware Doctor is a multi-award winning spyware removal utility that detects, removes and protects your PC from thousands of potential spyware, adware, trojans, keyloggers, spybots and tracking threats. <br />
<br />
The Spyware Doctor remover tool allows you to remove, ignore or quarantine identified Spyware for free in the trial version. It also has an OnGuard system to immunize <br />
and protect your system against hundreds of privacy threats as you work. <br />
<br />
By performing a fast detection at Windows start-up you will be alerted with a list of the potential threats identified. <br />
<br />
Here are some key features of "Spyware Doctor": <br />
<br />
· Detects and removes malware infections including spyware, adware, browser hijackers, Trojans, keyloggers, dialers and tracking cookies <br />
· Frequent Smart Updates to detect and guard against new infections as well as adding enhancements to Spyware Doctor <br />
· Rootkit scanning <br />
· Spider Scanning Technology (patent pending) <br />
· ADS detection &amp; removal capability <br />
· Malicious KL (Kernel Level) Process killer <br />
· A wide range of other sophisticated scanning tools <br />
· The OnGuard feature, designed for continual protection against malware infections and associated activities on your computer <br />
· Ability to quarantine and restore items that have been detected <br />
<br />
<br />
Limitations: <br />
<br />
· Download the latest version of Spyware Doctor and scan your PC for thousands of spyware, adware, and malware threats. Please note the trial version is limited to scan only. <br />
<br />
<br />
What's New in This Release: <br />
<br />
· A new OnGuard real-time protection tool, IM Guard, protects users of Instant Messaging applications such as MSN Messenger from access to any potentially malicious URLs received. Such URLs can lead to phishing sites or sites which attempt to exploit your web browser. <br />
· Some recent malware infections are installed as drivers which protect themselves from removal and along with other installed drivers, are protected from deletion by the operating system. However, Spyware Doctor has the capability of removing these malicious driver threats. Spyware Doctor is also capable of removing threats that attempt to shut down the Spyware Doctor application itself. <br />
· The Ignore List is used to prevent Spyware Doctor from detecting specific items that you wish to keep. However, some recent threats have been found to add themselves to the Ignore List in an attempt to compromise Spyware Doctor’s detection capabilities. Therefore, the security of the Ignore List has been enhanced and integrity checks implemented to prevent such threats from attempting to compromise Spyware Doctor’s effectiveness. <br />
· Spyware Doctor includes significant enhancements to its scanning tools. The Disk Scanner tool has the ability to detect and remove threats that attempt to avoid detection by using alternative character formatting. The Browser Activity Scanner is now also able to detect potentially malicious cookies stored by Mozilla Firefox web browser. <br />
· Spyware Doctor provides the option of creating a Windows System Restore point prior to threat removal. This works as a supplementary feature to Spyware Doctor's own Quarantine and Restore feature</font></p></p>
