<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">DAEMON Tools is an advanced application for multiprotection emulation. <br />
<br />
DAEMON Tools is further development of the Generic Safedisc emulatorincorporating all its features. This program allows running backupcopies of SafeDisc (C-Dilla), Securom or Laserlock protected games.<br />
<br />
Also included is a Virtual DVDROM drive (V386 STEALTH DVDROM) enablingyou to use your CD images as if they were already burned to CD. <br />
<br />
DAEMON Tools works under Windows9x/ME/NT/2000/XP with all types ofCD/DVDROM drives (IDE/SCSI) and supports nearly any CD protection.<br />
<br />
DAEMON Tools needs a 1:1 Copy to run!! <br />
DAEMON Tools is used to RUN GAMES, NOT TO BURN THEM!!! Means emulation must be active while youwant to play a game, not while burning the copy (except for you want touse DAEMON Tools "fastdump" feature on a safedisc protected CD). <br />
If you want to run a copy protected application from an image mountedto a Generic DVD-ROM enabling the copy protection emulation(s) is NOTnecessary!! <br />
Generic DVD-ROM is able to run nearly every protected or unprotectedCD image (Safedisc, Securom, Laserlock, Lockblocks etc.) like it wasthe original CD! Just do an image file using one of the supportedburning programs and mount it with Daemon Manager! <br />
