<p><font size="2"><p align="justify"><strong>AbsoluteFTP Publisher's Description:</strong> <br />
<font size="2">AbsoluteFTP is designed to make it easier to browse and download files from FTP sites. This 32-bit Winsock application uses the standard file-transfer protocol (FTP) to transfer files over the Internet and intranets. AbsoluteFTP offers a familiar Windows Explorer-type interface, drag-and-drop file-transfer capabilities, customizable file types, and multiple and simultaneous connections and transfers. Other features include firewall support, support for DOS FTP servers, SOCKS 5.0 firewall authentication, manual uploading, and TIS and WinGate proxy support. AbsoluteFTP also features server-to-server transfer and intraserver transfer capabilities, URL support, and a keep-alive feature. Newer versions have featured SecureFX, which lets you choose standard FTP or secure data transfer with FTP over an encrypted SSH2 connection. Other changes included an initial boot-up prompt for the user to create the application data folder, and a change of the maximum delay time between connection retries from 60 seconds to 9 hours. <br />
<br />
AbsoluteFTP 2.2 introduces improved remote editing by allowing the file being edited to be uploaded to the remote server each time the file is saved on the local machine. With multiple-file transfer support, an interrupted file transfer is resumed along with any other files in a job. <br />
<br />
New AFTPCL command-line utility switches include: <br />
<br />
- The location of the session database can be specified on the command line using /F. <br />
- Files can now be renamed with AFTPCL using /Rename flag. <br />
- Files can now be deleted with AFTPCL using /Delete flag. </font></p>
