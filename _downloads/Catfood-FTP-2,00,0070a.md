Catfood FTP (CFTP) is a rich command-line FTP tool that is well suited to updating web sites. <br />
<br />
CFTP supports transferring entire directory structures while automatically determining whether each file should be transferred in text or binary mode. <br />
<br />
Archive mode will only upload content that has been modified since the last transfer. <br />
<br />
It is also possible to transfer a single file, specify non-standard ports on the server and use an FTP proxy server. <br />
<br />
Advanced features include the ability to set permissions on UNIX servers (chmod) and selectively transfer files based on extension. <br />
<br />
Features: <br />
<br />
· <br />
Remote Browsing - remote browsing allows you to navigate to files and folders on an FTP server using the familiar Windows interface. Remote browsing supports accessing files below the login folder and allows new folders to be created. <br />
· Automatic Type Selection - Catfood FTP Wizard can automatically detect the type of file being transferred. This allows files to be moved without worrying about setting ASCII or BIN mode on the server - a common cause of problems when uploading web sites. <br />
· Archive Mode - Catfood FTP Wizard can be configured to only upload files that have changed since the last transfer. This powerful feature is ideal for updating web sites, performing off-site backups and limiting the amount of time needed to perform otherwise lengthy updates. Catfood FTP Wizard can also control the file extension types that are transferred and force ASCII or BIN mode transfers. <br />
· Chmod support - for servers supporting the SITE CHMOD command Catfood FTP Wizard allows UNIX file permissions to be set automatically. The chmod interface allows permissions to be set directly in octal or by manipulating each permission directly. <br />
· Transfer scripting - Catfood FTP Wizard allows any command to be sent to the server either before, during or after transfer. Script commands can be called for each file in the transfer and wildcard expansion allows the remote file to be included in the command. This feature allows Catfood FTP Wizard to be used with site specific commands, or to perform common tasks such as retrieving a directory listing after each transfer. <br />
· Catfood FTP also allows you to specify the non-standard ports on the server, use passive mode to transfer files, configure an FTP proxy server, generate time-stamped log files, ignore errors during transfer and more. <br />
