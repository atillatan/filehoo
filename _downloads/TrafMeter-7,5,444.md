<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>TrafMeteris a powerful IP traffic accounting and Network Monitoring applicationdesigned for administrators of small to medium size PC LANs running inall Windows systems. <br />
<br />
<br />
It makes easy to count custom IP packets and troubleshooting problemssaving your efforts as a network administrator. The main TrafMeter ideais "Capture all, count only useful".<br />
<br />
You can create counting rules for a single host, for a subnet, for aspecific group of hosts such as "for all hosts in your LAN" or "for allhosts not in your LAN". Moreover, it supports a traffic accounting perany IP protocol (ICMP, TCP, UDP, GRE, ESP, AH, L2TP) with splittingtraffic per port numbers (only for TCP and UDP). <br />
<br />
TrafMeter allows to visualize in realtime a traffic activity on thegraphic charts so you will be able to see which user is using theInternet connection most of all. <br />
<br />
The traffic counters or the custom packet headers can be stored in adatabase providing the ability to build various traffic reports ortraffic traces per month or/and per day. <br />
<br />
An exchanging data between TrafMeter and the database is doing by means of ADO interface that allows to write the traffic counters into the most popular databases (Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL). <br />
<br />
TrafMeter is designed to be run as a normal application, started viathe Windows Start menu. However, you can start TrafMeter as a WindowsNT/2000/XP/2003 service using freeware utility FireDaemon. <br />
<br />
TrafMeter has a simple, easy to understand user interface and a manual.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "TrafMeter":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Unlimited number of filters for captured traffic, defining network packets which are used for tracking/reporting. <br />
Creation of rulesets for various monitoring purposes. The rulesetscan be used for single hosts, subnets, as well as specific groups ofhosts - i.e. all hosts in/not in your LAN, specific IP protocols(ICMP,TCP,UDP,OSPF,etc). <br />
Real-time presentation of traffic activity via graphical charts. Eachfilter is represented by a unique color, which allows the webmasterand/or administrator to easily see the Internet connection usage ofindividual users. <br />
Traffic Report generation via XML. <br />
Recording Traffic Counters into the many common databases such asMicrosoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, MySQL and etc (not available inLite version). <br />
Tracking network packets for the different filters, letting youanalyze and comment on the monitored traffic which may include MACaddresses from Ethernet headers and the ToS field from IP headers (notavailable in Lite version). <br />
HTTP Host Header Logging (not available in Lite version). <br />
Creating unlimited number of user accounts and assigning to specificuser the permission for remote viewing of traffic counters. <br />
User authentication by TrafMeter native authentication or by Windowsdomain authentication: counting the traffic by usernames (solvingproblems with counting the traffic in DHCP-based network and spoofingIP- or MAC- addresses by the users) <br />
Packet filtering firewall. <br />
Traffic shaper (AKA Speed Control) <br />
Built-in NAT engine<br />
<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Limitations:</strong></span><br />
<br />
This software is distributed under freeware license. In the freewareperiod, you are allowed to use only three traffic filters. To useunlimited number of the filters, you should purchase a registration key.<br />

<strong>What s New</strong> in This Release:<br />
<br />
Fixed bug with detecting network adapters under Microsoft Windows Vista.<br />

Added auto-refreshing the list of network adapters (you can plug and unplug network adapters when Traffic Capture is running).<br />
New capture engine (solves compatibility problems with many firewalls).<br />
New Capture Mode called "Strong" (allows blocking all networking packets when TrafMeter Service is down).<br />
New feature: auto-sending Short Messages from Administrative Console to connected users when the traffic limit is exceeded.<br />
New feature: "Reverse counter" (allows to count the traffic in descending manner).<br />
New feature: Setting up any values of Traffic counters (using TrafMeter Administrative Console or built-in webserver)..</div></p></p>
