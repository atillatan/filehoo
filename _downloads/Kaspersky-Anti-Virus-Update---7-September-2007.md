<br />
Use this if you already have AntiViral Toolkit Pro installed.<br />
<br />
<strong>The standard antivirus databases currently contain 384804 records.</strong><br />
<br />
It is essential to update antivirus databases on a regular basis. Ifyou do not do this, your antivirus program will not detect newmalicious programs. This is why we release updates every hour, toensure that users are protected against the latest malware.<br />
<br />
Antivirus solutions from Kaspersky Lab not only detect malicioussoftware, but other programs which are potentially harmful, such as: <br />
<br />
- Adware <br />
- Remote administration programs <br />
- Utilities which can be used by malicious programs or users <br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff"><strong>Zip-archives should be unpacked </strong></font><font color="#0000ff"><strong>into a separate directory, which should then be indicated in the automatic update module as a local folder.</strong></font><br />
<br />
<strong>Daily</strong> - contains all updates and modifications released duringthe current week. The current week starts from the previous Friday,when the last weekly update was released. It is placed on the updateserver every hour. You should download daily.zip if you update yourantivirus databases at least once a week.<br />
<br />
<strong>Previous week s updates</strong> - contains all updates and modificationsreleased during the previous week (a full version of the week sdaily.zip). It is placed on the server once a week, on Friday. Whenthis file is placed on the server, it will cause the size of daily.zipto be equal to zero. You should download this file if you update yourantivirus databases less than once a week, but more often than onceevery two weeks.<br />
<br />
<strong>Complete update</strong> - contains all the updates and modificationsreleased at the time of the previous week s update. This is placed onthe sever at the same time as the new weekly.zip. You should downloadthis file if you have not updated your antivirus databases in the lasttwo weeks.<br />
<br />
<font color="#ff0000"><strong>NOTE:</strong></font> After the archives have beendownloaded, unpack them to a separate folder on a disc. If you havedownloaded several archives, unpack them in the following order: firstunpack av-i386-cumul.zip, then - av-i386-weekly.zip and the last -av-i386-daily.zip. Unpacking, click Yes when you are suggested toreplace files with the same name. <br />
