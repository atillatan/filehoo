and Linux executables.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here </strong><strong>are some key features of "UPX":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Excellent compression ratio: typically compresses better thanWinZip/zip/gzip, use UPX to decrease the size of your distribution ! <br />
Very fast decompression: ~10 MB/sec on an ancient Pentium 133, ~200 MB/sec on an Athlon XP 2000+. <br />
No memory overhead for your compressed executables because of in-place decompression. <br />
Safe: you can list, test and unpack your executables. Also, achecksum of both the compressed and uncompressed file is maintainedinternally. <br />
Universal: UPX can pack a number of executable formats. <br />
Portable: UPX is written in portable endian-neutral C++ <br />
Extendable: because of the class layout it s very easy to add new executable formats or new compression algorithms <br />
