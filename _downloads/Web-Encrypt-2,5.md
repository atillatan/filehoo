<p><font size="2"><p>As Internet has more and more influence on our lives and bussinessevery day, it became important factor in global economy. It created anew dimension not only in economics, but in almost every field ofsocial activities. Presenting your company on the Internet, as a newadvertising strategy, caused rapid increase of Web sites. So, Webdesign as a new occupation became very profitable, and the number ofpeople designing Web sites also increased. <br />
<br />
Every Web designer has it s own methods of creating Web pages, based onexperience gained through the hard work. So, it became important toensure originality, knowledge and developed methods from the others.Because of this need, Web Encrypt is ideal solution, as it offersprotection of both HTML code and scripts using special encryptingalgorithm. <br />
<br />
Many online companies are offering their services (like onlinetutorial, books and many other) to increase traffic on their sites.This will cause more people will see comercials (banners) advertisingvarious companies. Thus, main goal of these previously mentioned onlinecompanies is to increase their traffic. <br />
<br />
If some company is offering, for example, online tutorials, they wanttheir users constantly visiting these tutorials, not just downloadingand viewing them localy. That s beacuse users will more often seebanners, causing bigger probability for banner clicks, for which thecompanies are paid. <br />
<br />
There Web Encrypt takes place - securing online content from viewing these pages localy, viewing HTML and Javascript code or saving the images from the pages. <br />
<br />
Moreover, the compression that Web Encrypt provides will reducedownload time up to 4 times, this way enabling that even more usersbrowse the site at the same time(server s overload limit is dramaticalydecreased). <br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "Web Encrypt":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Required time for the high-end computer to break the protection ofthe encrypted page is one month. This program uses complex algorithm,based on the algorithm used mostly in military and counterintelligenceorganizations. Because of that, it s superior to other programs, and itcannot be broken using letter frequency analizator or some othermethods. Also, decoding is still quick. <br />
No need to have any plug-in installed to see encrypted pages. Youclients don t need to have additional plug-ins or programs installed,just Java compatible browser (like Internet Explorer, NetscapeNavigator...). <br />
Three layer protection Using three phased algorithm (codeoptimization, compression and encryption) your page will be ultimatelyprotected <br />
New! Upgraded decoder. Version 2.4 is using upgraded decoder which is also much better protected. <br />
Web Encrypt 2 has built-in compression, so your pages will be up to 4times smaller! Web Pressure, algorithm used for comression, is alsoour product, and the result of the scientific research (paper will bepresented on conference "Applied Mathematics" in June 2002) <br />
Folder encryption. Now, you can encrypt entire folders with its subfolders (recursively). <br />
URL lock. When this option is enabled, encrypted Web page will beseen properly only on the specified URL. Even when somebody saves thatpage, he will not be able to see it localy. <br />
Domain lock is similar to previous option, but, you don t have tospecify exact URL for each page. Very useful when you are encrypting afolder. <br />
Encrypted pages are language independent. Information about the codepage will be preserved, and you encrypted pages will also supportspecified code page. <br />
Password protection is an option which prompts client who is openingthe page to enter valid password. If the password is not correct, pagewill not be displayed properly. <br />
Support for large files. you can code and open files over 500 kB - Internet Explorer will open it in a few seconds. <br />
All 256 ASCII characters are supported. That means there is no possibility that some special characters won t be seen. <br />
Disable right mouse button clicks. This options will prevent stealing the images from your pages. <br />
Disable text selection - making impossible to select any part of the text from the page. <br />
Disable page printing - even if someone tries to print the encrypted page, he ll get only blank paper. <br />
Disable drag &amp;. drop - completely protect your images using this feature <br />
Disable image toolbar - Internet Explorer 6 has this option whichdisplays the toolbar over the image. This way you can save, print of email</a> the image. Using Disable image toolbar option will prevent displaying this toolbar. <br />
No cache Your pages will not be stored in cache memory <br />
Search engines friendly - Metas tag are preserved and placed at thebeginning of the document, so search engines can found keyword and rateyou page. <br />
You don t have to care about document syntax and structure - codeanalyzer can recognize a lot of HTML tags, comments and other. <br />
Code cleaning - code analyzer will remove all redundant code (comments, sequental new lines or blanks...) <br />
Completely new professionally designed Graphical User Interface. Newaqua-buttons along with the background will give a pleasantlook-and-feel. Also, GUI is very easy to use! <br />
Progress bars will indicate the remaining percentage to complete thework. And, you can stop or pause the process at any time you want!!!Normally, when you stop the process, everything will be return tonormal (previous) state. <br />
Backup of files and folders is made, so your original files are saved and reversible process is possible. <br />
Complete statictics about done processes. Stored in a form of thetextual file, you can read complete report about the process: date andtime, options selected, relative paths and names of all the encryptedfiles, overall length of the original files, overall length of theencrypted files, compression ratio. <br />
You can DECRYPT pages. Program wil recognize if the selected file (orfolder) has been encrypted, and by only hitting the button, wholefolder (or file) will be returned like it was before the encryption!! <br />
New registration method</p></p></p>
