I"…<p>EasyFind finds files and folders by name or content using advanced Boolean operators similar to DEVONthink and DEVONagent, wildcards, and phrases. It does not require indexing, is fast, and uses very little memory. Of course EasyFind doesnâ€™t just give you the files, it also shows previews and gives you many other options to work with them. And itâ€™s free. Life can be so good.</p>
