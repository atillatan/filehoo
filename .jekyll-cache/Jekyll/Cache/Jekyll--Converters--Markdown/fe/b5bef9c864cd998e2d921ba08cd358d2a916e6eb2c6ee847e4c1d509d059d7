Accelerate is an easy-to-use software program that improves Internet connection speed for dial-up modems, cable modems, DSL, and LAN connections.<br />
<br />
By default, most modems and network connections in Windows are notconfigured to transfer data at their maximum or their most efficientspeed (e.g 28800, 56KB). While the maximum transfer speed of amodem/network connection can only be changed by costly hardwareupgrades, Accelerate optimizes Windows settings for data transfer overmodem/network connections resulting in faster download speeds, fasterweb site loading, and an overall increase in web surfing session speed.Because modem/network settings are unique, Accelerate helps youfine-tune your specific settings to get the best-possible performanceout of your current hardware. <br />
<br />
A user-friendly acceleration wizard guides you through theoptimization process, allowing you to choose whether to change settingson your own or follow the recommend</p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
