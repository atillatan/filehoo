<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">Etherealwas designed to be a polyphonic synthesizer that uses advanced additivesynthesis, powerful envelopes and built in effects to create intricatepads and moving textures.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "CFX Ethereal":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Three oscillators, using 22 stored wavesforms and 6 user-definableones. The user waveforms are created using additive synthesis with 29harmonics or from user draw waves. Each oscillators is doubled foradded fatness.<br />
Each oscillator can load in samples, these samples can have there own key split and position envelope <br />
Each oscillator can be frequency modulated, using any of the waves as modulator or the output of any of the oscillators. Osc 2 &amp;. 3 can be synced to Osc 1 as well. <br />
Each oscillator s output is sent to one of two 12/24db low / high /band-pass / band-reject / comb / ring-mod / formant vowel filters.These two filters can be arranged serially or in parallel. Each filterhas built in distortion &amp;. keyboard tracking<br />
The oscillators and filters parameters are controllable using 32stage envelopes, each stage having variable slopes. Each envelope hasuser-definable loop / release points for complex patterns. <br />
LFO control of the pitch , volume , pan &amp;. filter frequency, eachLFO has it s own envelope for amplitude and frequency so for instanceyou can use LFO s whose frequency changes over time<br />
Four built in effects, chorus, reverb, delay and phaser + stereo widen , portamento and keyboard tracking. <br />
Preset Evolver and virtual keyboard<br />
Full midi automation with midi learn ability <br />
160 presets and a full manual are included,<br />
