<br />
BitDefender Free Edition v10 is a powerful antivirus tool with features that best meet your security needs. Ease of use and automatic updates make BitDefender Free Edition v10 an 'install and forget' antivirus product. <br />
<br />
Here are some key features of "BitDefender Free Edition": <br />
<br />
Antivirus <br />
Â· The mission of the Antivirus module is to ensure detection and removal of all viruses in the wild. BitDefender Antivirus uses robust scan engines, certified by ICSA Labs, Virus Bulletin, Checkmark, CheckVir and TÃœV. <br />
IMPROVED Proactive detection <br />
Â· B-HAVE (Behavioral Heuristic Analyzer in Virtual Environments) emulates <br />
a virtual computer-inside-a-computer where pieces of software are run in order to check for potential malware behavior. This BitDefender proprietary technology <br />
represents a new security layer that keeps the operating system safe from unknown viruses by detecting malicious pieces of code for which signatures have not been released yet. <br />
Spyware scanning and cleaning <br />
Â· BitDefender can scan your system, or part of it, for known spyware threats. The scan uses a constantly updated spyware signature database. <br />
Â· NEW Privacy protection <br />
Â· The privacy guard monitors HTTP (web) and SMTP (mail) traffic flowing out of your computer for what might be personal information â€“ like credit card numbers, SSNâ€™s and other user-defined strings, like, for example, bits of passwords. <br />
IMPROVED Deployment and use <br />
Â· A setup wizard starts immediately after installation, helping users select the most appropriate update settings, a scanning schedule and providing a quick path to registering and activating the product. <br />
IMPROVED User Experience <br />
Â· BitDefender redesigned the user experience, placing emphasis on ease of use and clutter avoidance. As a result, many BitDefender v10 modules require significantly less user interaction, through judicious use of automation and machine learning. <br />
Hourly Updates <br />
Â· Your copy of BitDefender will be updated 24 times a day over the Internet, directly or through a Proxy Server. The product is able to repair itself if necessary, by downloading the damaged or missing files from BitDefender servers. BitDefender license owners benefit from free virus definition updates and free product upgrades. <br />
NEW Rootkit Detection and Removal <br />
Â· A new BitDefender module looks for rootkits (malicious programs designed to control victim computers, while staying hidden) and removes them on detection. <br />
<br />
<br />
Requirements: <br />
<br />
Â· Pentium MMX 200 Mhz or higher processor <br />
Â· Minimum 64MB of RAM Memory (128MB recommended) <br />
Â· Minimum 40MB available hard disk space <br />
