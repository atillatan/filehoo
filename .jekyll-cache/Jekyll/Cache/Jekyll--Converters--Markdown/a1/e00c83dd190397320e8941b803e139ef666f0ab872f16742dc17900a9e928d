<p><font size="2">DownloadAccelerator Plus (DAP) will accelerate the speed with which you canreceive files over the Internet using FTP and HTTP protocols bysimultaneously downloading several file segments from the same ordifferent servers. <br />
<br />
Download Accelerator Plus enables you to pause and resume downloads, and to recover from a dropped Internet connection. <br />
<br />
In addition, DAP searches for mirrors and implements the downloads fromthe best or most responsive mirrors. It is configured by default toautomatically Integrate into your Explorer or Netscape browser when itis installed, and to self-activate each time a download is performed.<br />
<br />
No further configuration or action is required on your part - simplyuse your browser to access the desired site, click on the downloadfile, and respond to the self-explanatory DAP dialogs that appear.<br />
<br />
Advanced options enable you to tailor the operation and responses ofthe application to your needs. You can choose to trigger specificresponses such as messages, queue update, closing the application, anddisconnecting after the download is completed or is not available.<br />
