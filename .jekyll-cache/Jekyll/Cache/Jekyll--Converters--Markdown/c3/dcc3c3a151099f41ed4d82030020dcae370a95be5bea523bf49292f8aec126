<p><font size="2"><p>GSplit is a free original file splitter that will let you split yourlarge files (like Self-Extracting, Zip archives, multimedia, song,music, movie, backup, picture, archive, document files...) into a setof smaller files called pieces.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "GSplit":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Create two types of pieces: disk spanned and blocked (specific size).You can enter the size for each piece file or the number of pieces youwant to obtain.<br />
Generate small full-featured Self-Uniting programs to restore your split files professionally. They provide your users with an intuitive Windows interface whose appearancecan be customized according to your needs. GSplit is then not requiredin order to restore the split file.<br />
Store file properties and restore them: file s date, attributes are not lost contrary to batch files.<br />
Perform fast checks to detect file corruption (size, offset, CRC32)and to give you the assurance that your files are successfully restoredby your users. When a piece is corrupted, you are notified about it, soyou just need to get a new copy of that piece, not the whole set.<br />
Split very large files (normally bigger than 4 GB).<br />
Customize piece files according to your needs (size, filenames,title, author...), leave additional space on disks, create pieceswithout headers (useful for text-based files like large server logfiles).<br />
Support splitting multiple files in one time, include batch (automating) and command line options.<br />
Show you elapsed and estimated times during the splitting &amp;.uniting operations. You can also pause/resume the splitting operation.<br />
Store settings into profiles and let you use these settings fordifferent files, remember MRU files and folders, automatically try tofind out the best splitting settings...<br />
Integrate Windows Explorer to let you split your files directly from the context menu.<br />
