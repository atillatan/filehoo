    <strong>PortsLock 2.0 description</strong><br />
    A personal firewall for Windows that fully supports user-level security
  </h2>

<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>PortsLock is a firewall with user-level access controls for WindowsNT/2000/XP. Once PortsLock is installed, administrators can assignpermissions to TCP/IP connections, just as they would in managingpermissions on an NTFS partition of a hard disk. It lets you controlwhich users can access what TCP/IP based protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP,POP3 , Telnet, etc.) on a local computer, depending on the time ofday and day of the week. You can also set allowed/denied TCP/UDP portsand IP addresses for incoming and outgoing connections.<br />
PortsLock is a useful security tool that lets you to block ports and much more.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that almost 80% of all security breaches come from theinside! PortsLock enhances access control possibilities for systemadministrators, helps them to build a more secure network environment,and protects corporate networks against attacks from the inside.<br />
<br />
PortsLock is absolutely transparent to users. Users do not have to setup rules in their applications to use the network. Only administratorsare allowed to set rules so users without administrative privilegescannot bypass the PortsLock security. It is important to note thatPortsLock works perfectly with other personal firewalls and routersinstalled on the same computer.<br />
