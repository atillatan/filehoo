    <strong>PuTTY 0.60 description</strong><br />
    PuTTY is a free SSH, Telnet and Rlogin client for 32-bit Windows
  </h2>

<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>PuTTY is a very useful tool, a small freeware implementation of Telnetand SSH for Win32 platforms, along with an xterm terminal emulator.<br />
<br />
SSH, Telnet and Rlogin are three ways of doing the same thing: loggingin to a multi-user computer from another computer, over a network.<br />
<br />
Multi-user operating systems, such as Unix and VMS, usually present acommand-line interface to the user, much like the `Command Prompt or`MS-DOS Prompt in Windows. The system prints a prompt, and you type commands which the system will obey.<br />
<br />
Using this type of interface, there is no need for you to be sitting atthe same machine you are typing commands to. The commands, andresponses, can be sent over a network, so you can sit at one computerand give commands to another one, or even to more than one.<br />
<br />
SSH, Telnet and Rlogin are _network protocols_ that allow you to dothis. On the computer you sit at, you run a _client_, which makes anetwork connection to the other computer (the _server_). The networkconnection carries your keystrokes and commands from the client to theserver, and carries the server s responses back to you.<br />
<br />
These protocols can also be used for other types of keyboard-basedinteractive session. In particular, there are a lot of bulletin boards,talker systems and MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) which support accessusing Telnet. There are even a few that support SSH.<br />
<br />
<strong>LEGAL WARNING:</strong> Use of PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink is illegal incountries where encryption is outlawed. I believe it is legal to usePuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink in England and many other countries, but Iam not a lawyer and so if in doubt you should seek legal advice beforedownloading it. You may find this site useful (it s a survey ofcryptography laws in many countries) but I can t vouch for itsc</p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
