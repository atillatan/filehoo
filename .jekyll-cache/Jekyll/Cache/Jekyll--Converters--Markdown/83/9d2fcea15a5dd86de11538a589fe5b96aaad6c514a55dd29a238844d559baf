<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">FFPlayer is a simple, reliable, small and easy-to-use DirectShow-basedplayer that offers all the basic features someone may need.<br />
<br />
Inbetween it has many advanced features, great Windows Explorer Integration and has proven to be fast and stable<br />
<br />
FF Player is optimized for fast switching between video files by partlypre-loading the next file before switching. Due to the design of FFPlayer, the startup and shutdown times are very low, once the .NetFramework is initialized.<br />
<br />
FF Player features advanced explorer integration. You can selectmultiple files and open them all directly (by pressing return forexample). In comparison to most other players this will happen extremely fast if the player is already running and you won thave the player started multiple times simultanously. You canright-click selected media files and/or folders in Windows Explorer andchoose from options like "Play with FF Player", "Add to playlist","Play as next" (which will insert them directly under the currentlyplaying item). <br />
<br />
As windows explorer has the strange behaviour to often pass filesout-of-order, FF Player sorts files and folders before adding andplaying them.<br />
<br />
