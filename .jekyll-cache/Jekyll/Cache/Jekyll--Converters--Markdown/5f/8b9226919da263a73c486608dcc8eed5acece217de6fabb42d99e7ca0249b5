<font size="2"><strong>What s New</strong> in This Release:<br />
<br />
Options, Preferences, Editor: If the option to make Ctrl+Up/Down movebetween paragraphs is turned on, Ctrl+Arrow Up/Down now treats a blockof lines separated by a blank line as a paragraph instead of justmoving to the next line when word wrap is off. <br />
Explorer Panel: Favorite Folders item in the context menu now expandsto show the folders with options to add the selected folders andmaintain the folders. <br />
FTP: Directory listings will now include files that the FTP serverconsiders "hidden", such as the .htaccess file on a UNIX web server. <br />
File Types: Duplicate a file type by pressing Ctrl while clicking the New button in the file type configuration. <br />
Tools: Duplicate a tool by pressing Ctrl while clicking the New button in the tool configuration. <br />
Fixed: File|Reopen|Remove Obsolete Files: Files on drives that are nolonger available were not removed from the list of files (6.2.2 and6.3.0 only). <br />
Fixed: File|Save causes an "access denied" error when saving to ahidden file and no backup option is selected in Options, Preferences,Files. <br />
Fixed: Block|Begin Selection and End Selection did not always respect the Block|Rectangular Selections setting. <br />
Fixed: Clip Collection: The toolbar had two New Folder buttons instead of a New Collection and a New Folder button. <br />
Fixed: FTP: Don t disable the upload file button if no file or folder is selected. Simply upload it into the root folder. <br />
Fixed: Preferences, Files: Working copies were not opened whenopening projects and when EditPad automatically opens the lastworkspace. <br />
Fixed: Search: Incremental search should never move the keyboardfocus to the main editor, regardless of the setting in Options,Preferences, Editor. <br />
Fixed: Search: Turning on "case sensitive" when "adapt case" wasturned on would disable the "adapt case" checkbox, but still apply thecase adaptation even though it shouldn t. <br />
Fixed: Tools: Context menu items were not updated after reconfiguringthe tools if the context menu items contained tools but the toolbar didnot. ...</font></div></p>
