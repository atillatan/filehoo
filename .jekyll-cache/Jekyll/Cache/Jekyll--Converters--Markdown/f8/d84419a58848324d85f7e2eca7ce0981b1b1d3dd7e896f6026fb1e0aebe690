CreateInstall Light is a convenient installer that helps you create installation packages with user-friendly interface that have all the necessary features. <br />
<br />
CreateInstall is an installer for those who want to completely control the installation process. <br />
<br />
The entire installation process is presented as a sequence of commands. You can both use those commands that are already available and add any operation that you need. <br />
<br />
This feature of building your own installation packages makes CreateInstall an extremely powerful and flexible installer. <br />
<br />
The intuitive and simple interface makes your work with the program as easy as possible. It takes just a few minutes to familiarize <br />
yourself with the program and create your first installation package. <br />
<br />
Your installation packages will be compact and easy to install. The program has a set of standard features: Select language, Show license, Uninstall, Work with the Registry, Create shortcuts, Add VisualBasic and DAO files, Unpack and copy files, Multiple volume installations, etc. <br />
<br />
Using the universal programming Gentee language as your script installation language makes the features of your installation packages unlimited. <br />
<br />
Your installation packages will do only what you tell them to do. You will have complete control over the installation and uninstall processes. <br />
<br />
You can modify the interface of your dialog boxes, add your own resources, graphic items and also you will have about 100 KB of source code used in installation packages at your disposal. <br />
<br />
One of the components of the installer is the compression algorithms it uses. CreateInstall will meet the most stringent requirements here as well. You can choose between two basic compression algorithms. <br />
<br />
The first one ensures the perfect compression rate and the second one ensures a high decompression rate for files. You can use both algorithms for different groups of files in one installation package. <br />
<br />
The file compression component has many additional settings that can help you make the optimal installation package in regards to size and rate. <br />
<br />
You can easily import a ready project into CreateInstall and you will just have to add the necessary operations to customize it. <br />
<br />
You can also choose one of the two compression algorithms, specify your own icon, logo and other graphical elements, use the command line to run the process of creating installation packages and create installation packages that have no dialog boxes. <br />
<br />
It is impossible to enumerate everything that you can do with CreateInstall. It is a Lego that will allow you to create your installation package the way you want it to be. <br />
