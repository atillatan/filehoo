<h4 id="what-is-everything">What is “Everything”?</h4>

<p>“Everything” is search engine that locates files and folders by filename instantly for Windows.
Unlike Windows search “Everything” initially displays every file and folder on your computer (hence the name “Everything”).
You type in a search filter to limit what files and folders are displayed.</p>

<h4 id="how-long-will-it-take-to-index-my-files">How long will it take to index my files?</h4>

<p>“Everything” only indexes file and folder names and generally takes a few seconds to build its database.
A fresh install of Windows 10 (about 120,000 files) will take about 1 second to index.
1,000,000 files will take about 1 minute.</p>

<h4 id="does-everything-search-file-contents">Does Everything search file contents?</h4>

<p>Yes, “Everything” can search file content with the content: search function.
File content is not indexed, searching content is slow.</p>

<h4 id="does-everything-hog-my-system-resources">Does “Everything” hog my system resources?</h4>

<p>No, “Everything” uses very little system resources.
A fresh install of Windows 10 (about 120,000 files) will use about 14 MB of ram and less than 9 MB of disk space.
1,000,000 files will use about 75 MB of ram and 45 MB of disk space.</p>

<h4 id="does-everything-monitor-file-system-changes">Does “Everything” monitor file system changes?</h4>

<p>Yes, “Everything” does monitor file system changes.
Your search windows will reflect changes made to the file system.</p>

<h4 id="is-everything-free">Is “Everything” free?</h4>

<h4 id="does-everything-miss-changes-made-to-the-file-system-if-it-is-not-running">Does “Everything” miss changes made to the file system if it is not running?</h4>

<h4 id="what-are-the-system-requirements-for-everything">What are the system requirements for “Everything”?</h4>

<p>“Everything” will run on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10
NTFS indexing requires the Everything service or running “Everything” as administrator.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-convert-a-volume-to-ntfs">How do I convert a volume to NTFS?</h4>

<p>Please backup anything important before converting a volume to NTFS.
Once a volume is converted to NTFS it can not be converted back to FAT or FAT32.

<p>To convert a volume to NTFS:
From the Start menu, click Run.

<h4 id="why-is-everything-14-using-more-memory-than-13">Why is “Everything” 1.4 using more memory than 1.3?</h4>

<p>“Everything” 1.4 indexes file sizes and dates and also stores extra information for faster sorting by default.
Please see Optimizing for smallest memory foot print to disable these changes.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-prevent-the-uac-prompt-when-running-everything">How do I prevent the UAC prompt when running “Everything”?</h4>

<p>“Everything” requires administrative privileges for low level read access to NTFS volumes for NTFS indexing.</p>

<p>The UAC prompt can be avoided by running “Everything” as a standard user and installing the “Everything” service or not using NTFS indexing.</p>

<p>To run “Everything” as a standard user and install the “Everything” service:
In “Everything”, from the Tools menu, click Options.
Click the General tab.
Check Everything Service.
Uncheck Run as administrator.
Click OK.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
