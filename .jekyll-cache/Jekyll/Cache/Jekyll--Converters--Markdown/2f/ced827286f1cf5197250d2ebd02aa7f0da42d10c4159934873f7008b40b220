<strong>What s New</strong> in This Release:<br />
<br />
Fixed: Scheduled events were not firing. <br />
Fixed: The time of the last command was not being updated for someSFTP commands resulting in an incorrect idle connection timeout thatwould close the SFTP connection during long file transfers. <br />
Fixed: The Event Manager was not reloading the events list when events were added, deleted, or disabled/enabled. <br />
Fixed: Memory leak that would occur if the same user logged in multiple times repeatedly. <br />
Fixed: Idle connections were not being closed properly if terminated non-gracefully when a user was not logged in. <br />
Fixed: COM/srxCFG issue which would not properly retain existing Group settings when adding members to groups. <br />
Fixed: Optimized ftp connection subsystems to allow more concurrent connections to be serviced simultaneously. <br />
Fixed: Optimized connection memory usage to limit the amount ofsystem memory each connection uses. This will decrease the memoryfootprint of Titan under heavy loads. <br />
Fixed: SSL data connections were not being encrypted unless PROT P was issued. <br />
Fixed: The response to a QUIT command was not sent properly prior to closing the connection. <br />
Fixed: using GETUATTR GETSATTR and GETGATTR in srxCFG would result in a buffer overflow and/or invalid attributes <br />
Fixed: srxCFG would not set the users password correctly. <br />
Fixed: srxCFG would not generate a list of users properly. <br />
Fixed: Potential buffer overflow issue in the log manager if user supplied invalid content from an ftp client. <br />
Fixed: PASV mode issue resulting in a 421 memory error if FTP was disabled but FTPS was enabled. <br />
Changed: Increased the default flood protection values to 100connections in 5 seconds to minimize the risk of valid connectionsbeing banned.... [ </div>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
