A software application that undeletes accidentally deleted files even from recycle bin <br />
<br />
DataRecovery is freeware and written by TOKIWA to undelete accidentally deleted files even from recycle bin. <br />
<br />
But DataRecovery doesn't assure that all files deleted can be recovered successfully. <br />
<br />
DataRecovery mostly depends on your system/configuration and we can't support each of all those varieties. <br />
<br />
You need "administrator account" to run DataRecovery at WinNT/2000/XP/Vista. <br />
To wipe out deleted files, DataRecovery directly write NULL to disc. <br />
On FAT volume, first <br />
character of the file name is sometimes overwritten by delete-code on deletion. In that case the lost character is replaced by "$" on the list displayed. <br />
On Windows Vista, due to file protection of OS, you can not wipe out files. <br />
Norton UnErase keeps DataRecovery from scanning deleted files. <br />
When you get "Runtime Error" on scanning drive, then mail to TOKIWA, you will receive Debug version. <br />
<br />
Here are some key features of "DataRecovery": <br />
<br />
Â· FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS undeletion <br />
Â· undelete NTFS compressed files <br />
Â· undelete EFS encrypted files <br />
Â· wipe out deleted files never to be recovered again <br />
Â· runnable from floppy disk <br />
Â· search by partial string in the file name <br />
Â· undelete whole files in a directory <br />
Â· undelete multiple files by selecting them with Shift/Ctrl key <br />
Â· sort items displayed by clicking column headers <br />
Â· neither installation nor DLLs is needed <br />
Â· Windows Vista supported <br />
<br />
<br />
What's New in This Release: <br />
<br />
Â· improved scanning speed <br />
Â· resizable main window <br />
Â· fixed multithread related bugs <br />
Â· improved user interface... <br />
