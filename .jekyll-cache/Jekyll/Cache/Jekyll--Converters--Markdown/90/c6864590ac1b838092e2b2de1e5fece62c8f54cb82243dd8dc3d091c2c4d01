    <strong>SpamPal 1.73h Beta description</strong><br />
    free anti-spam utility. Separates your spam from the mail you really want to read
  </h2>

<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>SpamPal sits between your email&lt;/a&gt; program and your mailbox, checking your email as you retrieve it. <br />
<br />
Any emails that SpamPal will consider to be spam are "tagged" with aspecial header. you will be able to easily configure your email clientto filter anything with this header into a separate folder and yourspam won t be mixed up with the rest of your emails anymore.<br />
<br />
<span class="articleDetailsLink"><strong>Features:</strong></span><br />
<br />
Check your mail against the freely-usable DNSBL lists (aka "blocking lists") of your choice. <br />
The list of available DNSBL services is automatically updated, so new DNSBL lists can be used as they appear! <br />
Whitelist the email addresses of your friends and family so that mail from them will never be tagged as spam! <br />
Don t agree with a listing in a DNSBL list? You can whitelist entirenetblocks so you ll never be troubled by that listing again! <br />
Do you think part of the Internet should be blocked that isn t in aDNSBL list? Add it to the local blacklist and all mail from it will betagged as spam! You can blacklist email addresses or entire netblocks! <br />
People and mailservers with whom you correspond frequently areAutomatically Whitelisted - without you having to lift a finger! <br />
More than one mailbox? Don t worry, SpamPal supports multiple POP3 servers. <br />
Supports APOP authentication! <br />
Can filter IMAP4 mailboxes! <br />
Can even protect an SMTP connection! <br />
Unobtrusive! Once installed, SpamPal sits in your system tray and youcan forget all about it - except spam won t be causing you so muchtrouble! <br />
Multi-language support! Use SpamPal in English, German, French, Italian or Russian <br />
Subject Line Tagging. As well as its special header, SpamPal can put "**SPAM**" in the subject of spam messages. <br />
And if all this isn t enough, you can extend SpamPal with third-party Plug-ins! <br />
SpamPal will not be able to detect all of your spam. However, I thinkit will detect enough to make a considerable difference!</p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
