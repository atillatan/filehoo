    Wintail is a small FREE program like a tail in UNIX It is much more useful than even the UNIX tail -f because you can have several tiled windows open at once, and you can pause updates while looking closely at the file. Very large files are supported (over 2 GB) and  highlighting is available to make errors easier to spot in log files.

<p>Wintail is a small FREE program like a tail in UNIX
It is much more useful than even the UNIX tail -f because you can have several tiled windows open at once, and you can pause updates while looking closely at the file. Very large files are supported (over 2 GB) and  highlighting is available to make errors easier to spot in log files.</p>

<p>Hoo WinTail is a real-time log monitor and log viewer for Windows like the UNIX tail -f utility. It could be used to view the end of a growing file. It is ideal for viewing application traces or server log in real-time. You can view the last part of a large file quickly without the need to load the entire file. Hoo WinTail could capture and display OutputDebugString (Windows debugging API) output as well.</p>

<p>Hoo WinTail has many excellent features for debugging program and system administration: highlight filters, include and exclude filters, regular expression for filters, monitor multiple log files, bookmarks support, minimize to systray and flash systray icon to indicate new lines written and so on.</p>

<p>Hoo WinTail is a file viewer only. It makes no changes to log files. It opens log files in read-only mode. When new lines are written to log file by other programs (e.g. your applications or web server), Hoo WinTail reads the new lines and displays them.</p>
