    MemTest - evaluates the ability of your computer  s memory to store and retrieve data 
  </h2>

<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>MemTest is a RAM reliability tester. It evaluates the ability of yourcomputer s memory to store and retrieve data without errors. <br />
<br />
A correctly functioning computer should be able to do both these taskswith 100% accuracy day in and day out. A computer that fails thesetests, perhaps because of old hardware, damaged hardware, or poorlyconfigured hardware, will be less stable and crash more often. <br />
<br />
Even worse, it will become even less stable over time as corrupted data is written to your hard disk. <br />
<br />
By running MemTest you can ensure that your computer s RAM is correctlyfunctioning. It is wise to test this when you buy a new computer,install new ram, or change the configuration of your machine (forinstance, to overclock it). <br />
<br />
If you are the sort of user who likes to push the performance of yourmachine to the edge, relying upon whether your machine will boot afteryour new BIOS tweaks is a poor way to determine the safety of your newsettings. Use MemTest as a true test of stability. <br />
<br />
<strong>Limitations:</strong> The Pro version is also a Windows native program,and similar to the normal version. It is tuned, however, to the needsof users who diagnose the quality of ram often, or on multiplemachines. It offers options like a nice mode which allows you to testRAM in the background, during normal use of the machine, as well asmore detailed reporting of errors. <br />
<br />
It also does not pause every time an error is found, so it can be usedto determine the overall reliability of ram that is prone to errors,rather than just as a tool that determines if there are any erro</p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
