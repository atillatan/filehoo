<strong>What s New</strong> in This Release:<br />
<br />
Symantec pcAnywhere now introduces support for Mac OS X on both sidesof the remote session, in addition to current support for Windows andLinux. <br />
For simple connectivity, the pcAnywhere Gateway provides a singleconnection point behind routers and firewalls, minimizing portconfiguration and eliminating any need to "daisy-chain" remote sessionswithin one another. The Host Invitation feature enables connections tobe made from Host to Remote (rather than the traditional Remote toHost), minimizing any potential issues introduced by routers,firewalls, and dynamic IP addressing - invitation objects can beemailed directly to the Host user for immediate secure access!<br />
The pcAnywhere CrossPlatform Remote, Basic View and Tabbed SessionManager all streamline the remote access connection and navigationprocess. The CrossPlatform Remote enables monitoring of multiple activeremote sessions simultaneously in a single multi-pane view!<br />
Of course, pcAnywhere Mobile still enables Pocket PC connections toany supported pcAnywhere Host device, regardless of host platform - nowwith Remote Management tools to help</div>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
