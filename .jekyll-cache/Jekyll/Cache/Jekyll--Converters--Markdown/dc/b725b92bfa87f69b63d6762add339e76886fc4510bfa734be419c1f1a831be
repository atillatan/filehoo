    A powerful tool for morphing pictures and videos with complete video editing and video capture functionality
  </h2>

<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>Morphman is a powerful tool for morphing pictures and videos.<br />
<br />
Morphman creates a sequence of intermediate frames that seamlesslytransform one image to another and generates output in a form of videoor image file sequence.<br />
<br />
MorphMan comes bundled with the full-featured video editor, completewith multitrack video and audio composition functions, dynamic effects,transitions, titling, color keying, and capture module which allows fordirect import of clips from DV cameras and other video capture hardware.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "MorphMan":</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong>Picture-to-picture morphing features</strong><br />
Onion Skin interface as alternative option to double-window interface<br />
Vector drawing tools for fast, easy, and precise positioning of control points and lines (markers) <br />
Primitives and shapes for setting control markers <br />
Editing of shapes <br />
Grouping and ungrouping of markers <br />
Transformation tools for groups of control markers<br />
Smart Polygon, Snap to Edges, Grasp<br />
Vector editing tools for mask<br />
multiple fast morphing algorithms<br />
ability to specify individual transition path for each control marker or shape<br />
<br />
<strong>Video-to-video morphing features</strong><br />
Import movie clips as Source and Target for morphing project<br />
Sequence Browser to scroll sequence of morphs between corresponding frames of input clips<br />
Tune source and target clips to choose interval for morphing<br />
Set key markers and jey frames for manual adjustment of morphing transition in intermediate frames of the sequence<br />
Propagate Markers - function to facilitate placement of markers in intermediate frames in video-to-video morphing<br />
<br />
<strong>Video editing</strong><br />
Complete video editing and video capture functionality provided by bundled Video Man 3.0 and Video Man Capturer<br />
Multiple video and audio tracks, overlays, text, transitions, dynamic effects, motions paths<br />
<br />
<strong>Interface</strong><br />
Real-time real-mode preview of any frame of the sequence <br />
Unlimited Undo of all operations including setting/editing markers and project properties changes <br />
Animated tutorial with multiple lessons <br />
Context help <br />
Swap function for easier sequential morphing <br />
Link Windows function for easier setting of control points in distortion morphs <br />
Storing workplace layout in morph project<br />
Batch rendering mode<br />
<br />
<strong>Import/Output</strong> <br />
Import frames and clips from AVI, MPEG, QuickTime, DV movies, and picture sequences <br />
Import frames from TWAIN devices <br />
Render to MPEG, QuickTime, DV movies, AVI, or picture sequences <br />
Render to animated GIF <br />
