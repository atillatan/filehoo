<p><font size="2"><p>VisitURLis a flexible, efficient, lightweight bookmark manager, one of the bestexisting solutions for you to maintain a list of bookmarks.<br />
<br />
VisitURL is not a fully-fledged bookmark manager. It is not areplacement for Netscape s bookmark file or Internet Explorer sFavorites. It does not organize bookmarks into categories. <br />
<br />
VisitURL is designed to help maintain a handy (as in: at hand) list ofURLs that you intend to visit. For instance, if a friend sends you an email recommending that a particular URL, Visit is a good place to store the URL until you are ready to launch your browser and go surfing. <br />
<br />
If you copy the URL to clipboard, Visit will automatically intercept itand save to its database. If you copy several URLs at once, Visit willget all of them. (You may also add URLs manually or directly from anopen browser window.) If you copy the URL with some text around it,Visit will optionally treat that text as a description for the URL youcopied. <br />
<br />
To access the bookmarked site, you can either view the HTML page thatVisit creates in your browser, or click a toolbar button to launch thebrowser directly from Visit. <br />
<br />
There is no limit to how many URLs you may store, though the program isprimarily designed to hold, view and edit a short, temporary list.Netscape and Explorer tend to consume so much system resources thatit s not practical to keep them loaded at all times - this is whereVisit comes in. <br />
<br />

Bookmarks may be imported and exported in a variety of ways.<br />
