<p><font size="2">A system optimization tool used by millions across the globe <br />
CCleaner (Crap Cleaner) is a freeware system optimisation tool. <br />
<br />
CCleaner removes unused and temporary files from your system - allowing it to run faster, more efficiently and giving you more HDD space. <br />
<br />
The best part is that it's fast (normally taking less that a second to run) and Free. <br />
<br />
24 February 2006: CCleaner is now available without the Yahoo! Toolbar, so we have restored the award and uploaded on our servers the version without extra languages. <br />
<br />
We strive to offer our users only the latest software versions, therefore we will initially provide the adware version of CCleaner, as soon as it is released. We will update the listing leaving only the ad-free version when that will be released. <br />
<br />
Here are some key features of "CCleaner": <br />
<br />
Cleans the following Windows components: <br />
Internet Explorer <br />
· Temporary File Cache <br />
· URL History <br />
· Cookies <br />
· Hidden Index.dat files <br />
· Last download file location <br />
<br />
Firefox <br />
· Temporary File Cache <br />
· URL History <br />
· Cookies <br />
· <br />
Download manager <br />
<br />
· Recycle Bin <br />
· Clipboard <br />
· Windows Temporary files <br />
· Windows Log files <br />
· Recent Documents (on the Start Menu) <br />
· Run history (on the Start Menu) <br />

Including: Firefox, Opera, Safari, Media Player, eMule, Kazaa, Google Toolbar, Netscape, Microsoft Office, Nero, Adobe Acrobat Reader, WinRAR, WinAce, WinZip and more... <br />
<br />
· Registry Cleaning: <br />

<br />
· Safety: <br />
CCleaner was designed from the ground to be safe and secure to use. It has multiple levels of checks in place to ensure that it cannot delete any useful information or documents you may still need. We also certify that it contains no Spyware or Adware. <br />
<br />
· High Security: <br />
For the super cautious users we also offer secure file erasing. By overwriting the files before deleting them, making it impossible to recover the data. <br />
