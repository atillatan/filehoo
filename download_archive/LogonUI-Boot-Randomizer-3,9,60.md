<p><font size="2"><p>LogonUI Boot RandomizerIt s a Logon and Boot screens manager for WinXP (based on an idea by M. Deepak)<br />
<br />
Program is designed to interact as little as possible with the user. Ifyou set randomizing to main (base) folder (see How it works), everytime you download a new boot/screen folder and put it where you want,there is no need to run the program again. It will include the newscreen automatically. Also, if you exclude a category (folder) fromrandomize (see A Note for Exclude), in order to exclude screens fromrandomize them, when you download a new one and put it there, there isno need to run the program and update the exclude with the new screen.Program it will excluded automatically.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "LogonUI Boot Randomizer":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Changes the Logon and Boot screens in WinXP. Full support for SP1 and SP2 (I mean that you can use any version for boot screen and program will make it compatible with your system).<br />
Randomize (3 methods) the Logon and Boot screens. In order torandomize there is NO need to load the program to tray or somethinglike that. If you set randomizing the program will run the appropriatetime, randomize the logon/boot screen and then close. <br />
Full support for zip files. After downloading a screen (the zipfile), just put it in any subfolder under the base folder. Program willhandle it as a normal screen/folder.<br />
EXCLUDE some folders (screens) from randomize them (see A Note for Exclude).<br />
For boot screens, you can set or randomize them with 2 methods: 1)classic (using the exe file you download) or 2) using 3 bitmaps(existing or by extracting them from the exe file on fly and use them).All methods support all known features. Program always remember theposition of progress bar.<br />
Support for extracting boot and/or logon screens directly from zipfiles. Program can automatically detect the type of screen and extractit to the right folder with out user input.<br />
Preview (classic or with THUMBNAILS) the Logon and Boot screens, ifthe new logon/boot screen comes with a .jpg or .bmp file. If not, thereis a feature that you can browse and see all the bitmaps in the file.Also you can SAVE that bitmaps in jpg/gif/tiff/png/bmp format. With oneclick, you can save bitmap 100 (for logon screens) or bitmap 1 (forboot screens), which usually are the bitmaps with the basic picture.Also, support for MULTIPLE extract and save in jpg/gif/tiff/png/bmpformat (very helpful for users that have a lot of screens with out apreview picture).<br />
In order to load pictures faster at THUMBNAILS preview, program afterdetect NEW zip files, will prompt you to search the zip files forpictures. After searching, will extract the picture (if any) and saveit to disk under the name "<name file="" zip="" of=""></name>.zip.jpg". The real format of the picture can be jpg/gif/tiff/png/bmp but after extraction the extension ALWAYS be .jpg<br />
