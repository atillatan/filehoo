<p><font size="2">eMule is a filesharing client based on the eDonkey2000 protocol. Whichmeans you are able to connect to official eDoneky2000 clients andvisa-versa usign eMule.<br />
<br />
<strong>Some factors that influence the download speed:</strong><br />
eMules settings<br />
High ID (Firewall and router settings)<br />
Duration of the eMule session<br />
Number of sources for a download<br />
Availability of single parts<br />
Popularity of the download<br />
<br />
Wrong settings in eMule (wrong limits, too many connections), a low IDand a short sessions durations have a bad impact on download speed.Very popular files (new releases) and generally files with a low number of sources or bad part spreading also cause low download rates.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "eMule":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Clients use several networks to create one reliable network. (ED2K, Source Exchange, Kad) <br />
Kad is now in an open testphase, eMule v0.42 can be enabled to use Kad <br />
eMule s Queue and Credit system helps to ensure that everyone willget the file he wants by promoting those that upload back to thenetwork. <br />
eMule is completely free. eMule is also completely free of anyAdware, Spyware, and etc. We do this for fun and knowledge, not formoney. <br />
Each file checked for corruptions while downloading to ensure an error free file. <br />
The eMules Intelligent Corruption Control helps to speed up the correction of corrupted parts. <br />
Auto priorities and Source management allows you to start many downloads without having to monitor them. <br />
The Preview function allows you to look at your Videos and Archivesbefore they are completed. For video previewing, we recommend the VideoLan Client. <br />
The eMule features webservices and a webserver that allows you to have quick access to and from the internet. <br />
You can create categories for your download to organize them. <br />
To find the file you want, eMule offers a wide range of search possibilities which include: </font><font size="2">Servers</font><font size="2"> (Local, and Global), web based (Jigle, and Filedonkey), and Kad (Still in Alpha). <br />
eMule also allows you to use very complex Boolean searches that make the searches much more flexible. <br />
With the messaging and friend system, you can send messages to otherClients and add them as friends. In your friend list, you can alwayssee if a friend is online. <br />
With the build in IRC client, you can chat with other downloaders and chatters around the globe<br />
