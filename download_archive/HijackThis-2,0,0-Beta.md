<p><font size="2">HijackThis, a general homepage hijackers detector and remover. <br />
<br />
Initially based on the article Hijacked!, but expanded with almost adozen other checks against hijacker tricks. It is continually updatedto detect and remove new hijacks. <br />
<br />
HijackThis does not target specific programs/URLs, just the methods used by hijackers to force you onto their sites. <br />
<br />
As a result, false positives are imminent and unless you are sure whatyou re doing, you should always consult with knowledgable folks (e.g.the forums) before deleting anything. </font></p>
