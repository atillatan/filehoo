<br />
EmEditor is designed for Windows XP, and certified for Windows Vista! The x64 Edition is also available!<br />
<br />
EmEditor Professional creates functionally-rich macros using JavaScriptor VBScript, allowing you to define most operations. Not only can youdefine a macro which records keystrokes that you use and referencerepeatedly, but you can also write your own macros that can manipulateother applications, Windowsâ€‘.based files, or network functionalities. <br />
<br />
The macros are based on the Windows Scripting Host (WSH) engine, soyou can use all of the powerful, robust objects available under theWindows Scripting Host.<br />
<br />
EmEditor Professional is a tool that allows you to edit text files.<br />
<br />
EmEditor Professional features two newly added configurations:JavaScript for EmEditor and VBScript for EmEditor. When you open amacro file in EmEditor, keywords, such as macro objects, properties, ormethods, are automatically highlighted. For assistance on certainkeywords, move the cursor over the keyword and select Search forKeyword, or press F1. <br />
<br />
When an error occurs during the execution of a macro, a dialog box willappear showing the content of the error. If you click on the Editbutton, you can jump to the location where the error occurred.<br />

EmEditor uses JavaScript or VBScript for its macro language, so thosewho are familiar with HTML or Windows scripting will be able to writemacros with little difficulty.
