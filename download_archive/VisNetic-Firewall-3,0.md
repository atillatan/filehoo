<p><font size="2"><p>VisNetic Firewall delivers protection to security-conscious professionals. <br />
<br />
More secure than the average personal firewall or application-levelfirewall, yet more cost effective than high-end firewalls, VisNeticFirewall provides peace-of-mind through comprehensive intrusionprotection. <br />
<br />
VisNetic Firewall examines each packet being sent, inside and outsideof the network to verify whether the packet is allowed or denied accessthrough the firewall. <br />
<br />
VisNetic Firewall guards the computers of Telecommuters/Mobile Users, Windows-based Workstations, Windows-based Servers, and Business Networks. <br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "VisNetic Firewall":</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span align="">Stateful Packet Inspection</span><br />
<br />
VisNetic Firewall falls into a class of firewalls called StatefulInspection Firewalls. Stateful inspection firewalls determine whetherpackets can get through the firewall based on the protocol, port, andsource and destination addresses. For every request that is allowed bythis strategy, stateful inspection firewalls open up a limited timewindow to allow response packets, but ONLY from the same host.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span align="">Port Scan Detection</span><br />
<br />
VisNetic Firewall detects the seven most common forms of port scans, alerting youwith a log entry and optionally automatically banning the IP address ofthe scanner, ensuring that they are "cut off" before they can discoverany useful information about your system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span align="">SYN Flood Detection</span> <br />
<br />
A SYN Flood is a common type of denial of service (DoS) attack usedagainst servers. When launching a SYN Flood, an attacker bombards youwith so many connection requests that your computer is unable to acceptlegitimate connections, effectively shutting down your web, email</a>, FTP or VPN server. VisNetic Firewall employs SYN cookies to protect you from SYN Flood attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span align="">Remote Administration</span> <br />
<br />
Using the remote administration component of the Server version ofVisNetic Firewall, you can now remotely administer any VisNeticFirewall using an encrypted communications link. You can also reboot orshut down the remote system using the remote admin controls. Inaddition to remotely administering other Server or Workstationfirewalls, you can use the stand-alone Remote Administration Tool toremotely connect to your own Server firewall.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span align="">IP Address Ban List</span> <br />
<br />
VisNetic Firewall lets you block IP addresses or ranges of addresses toprevent unwanted connection attempts. This can be particularlyeffective in stopping repeated requests from a hacker who is trying alarge number of hacks, looking for one that works. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span align="">HTTP Filtering</span> <br />
<br />
Using VisNetic Firewall’.s HTTP Filtering, you can prevent intrusion attempts targeted at your web server</a> by screening requests and automatically banning the offender’.s IP address, preventing further access.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span align="">MAC Address Filtering</span> <br />
<br />
VisNetic Firewall now has the ability to filter traffic based on MACaddresses. Because a MAC address is specific to one individual networkinterface, this feature is particularly useful if you want to allow orblock traffic from a particular computer whose IP address may change.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Requirements:</strong></span><br />
