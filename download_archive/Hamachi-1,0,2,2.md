<p><font size="2"><p>Hamachi will allow you to establish secure direct connections to PC sthat are not accessible otherwise due to the restrictions in networksetup. <br />
<br />
For example, if your home computer is connected to the Internet viaConnection Sharing or Broadband Router, you will not generally be ableto access it, say, from your office. <br />
<br />
By installing Hamachi on both computers and clicking a couple of buttons you can connect them instantly and securely. Now you can browse file shares, run remote desktop or even hosta multiplayer game on one computer and join in from another. Just as ifthey were connected with a physical wire. <br />
<br />
Hamachi is a networking technology enabling any two computers on theInternet to talk directly to each other regardless of the presence offirewalls or address translation devices on the route between them. <br />
<br />
Most interestingly, Hamachi enables peer-to-peer communications betweentwo computers residing behind two different connection sharing devices.In geek language - it allows for bidirectional NAT traversal.<br />
<br />
Peer to peer connectivity becomes possible with the help of Hamachiservers that mediate the establishment of an initial contact betweenpeers. <br />
<br />
Once peers connect the traffic starts to flow directly between them.This not only ensures that data travels the best route possible, but italso minimizes latency (ping time) and maximizes transfer speeds.<br />
<br />
Hamachi is secure. All Hamachi communications are encrypted andauthenticated using industry-standard algorithms and protocols. Nobodywill be able to see what two Hamachi peers are talking about. <br />
<br />
However what is more important - Hamachi security architecture iscompletely open meaning that its detailed description is available forreview to anyone</p></p></p>
