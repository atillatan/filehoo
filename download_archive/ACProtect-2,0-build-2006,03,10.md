<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">ACProtect is a program that will allow you to protect Windowsexecutable files against piracy, using public keys encryptionalgorithms (RSA) to create and verify the registration keys and unlocksome RSA key locked code, it has embedded cryptor against dump andunpacker.<br />
<br />
It also has many anti debug tricks. With specialized API system, mutualcommunication between loader and application can also be achieved.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "ACProtect":</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong>Embedded Protector</strong>- You can specify the place in your application to embed the innercryptor. With the embedded cryptor, your application can not be crackedeven though the cracker know the original entry point (OEP) when rebuilding your Import table.<br />
<br />
<strong>Code Replace</strong> - Acprotect will replace some of yourprogram s code with the same function code in the ACProtect codes,Ifthe ACPrtect code are stripped ,then the codes replaced will notfunction normally.<br />
<br />
<strong>Metamorph Engine</strong> - Metamorphdecryption routines and several encrypted layers. The code beingprotected varies every time you protect your application.<br />
<br />
<strong>RSA 1024 License</strong>- With RSA keys system a cracker can not write a KeyGen (or KeyMaker)for your product without the RSA private key (the RSA private key isonly in the author s hand). You may also specify some code to be lockedby the RSA keys, the cracker won t have the proper "key.dat" on theproper machine, without it the protected code can not decrypt.<br />
<br />
<strong>Mutual Communication</strong>- API system which allows communication between application and loader,loader can call some of the application s export function, and theapplication can call the function the protected system provided.<br />
<br />
<strong>Anti Patch/Loader</strong> - Protects your files against patching/modifications and disassembling.<br />
<br />
<strong>Anti-SoftIce</strong> - Numega SoftIce (tm) detection and Frogsice detection<br />
<br />
<strong>Anti Debug/Dump/Trace</strong>- Anti-debugger &amp;. Monitor like W32Dasm, SoftIce, TRW 2000, TurboDebugger, Sourcer, Filemon, ExeSpy, ResSpy, RegMon, Memory Monitor etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>Runtime Code Encryption</strong> - Important parts of your code can be protected individually, providing extra protection against memory patches.<br />
<br />
<strong>System-Specific Licenses</strong>- License keys may be locked to a specific system by checking the userdefined computer s unique fingerprint (such as Harddisk ID, CPU ID etc.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Stolen keys</strong> - Keeping of the database and checkup of "stolen" (illegal) registration keys.<br />
<br />
<strong>Trial setting</strong>- Possibility to create evaluation (trial) versions, that limitapplication functions based on the number of runs left . number of daysleft or deadline limit. <br />
<br />
