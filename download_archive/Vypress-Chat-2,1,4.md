<p><font size="2"><p>VypressChat is a user-friendly application for real-time chatting in smalloffice or home office (SOHO) local networks. This unique chat softwarefeatures an easy-to-understand format for text-based conferences anddiscussions. Vypress Chat does not require an Internet connection or adedicated server to support discussions, and all users have equalaccess to the application’.s tools and functions. Vypress Chat enablesindividuals to instantly communicate about joint projects, and managerscan send instantaneous memos to individuals, departments, or the entirecompany. <br />
<br />
<strong>No Network Management Needed</strong><br />
<br />
At VyPRESS, we recognize that most small local area networks (LANs)have no professional network administrator to manage softwareinstallation and provide user training. Thus, one of our major goalswhen creating Vypress Chat was to develop chat software with absolutelyzero management requirements. To achieve this, we deliberately left outcertain advanced configuration features in order to make Vypress Chat100% chat-ready immediately after installation. Now, all you need tocreate the easiest and most comfortable “.talk environment”. availablefor your SOHO network is to install the all-new Vypress Chat! <br />
<br />
<strong>Getting Started is Easy</strong><br />
<br />
After installation, Vypress Chat automatically starts with Windows andthe appropriate icons will be added to the System tray. At startup, allVypress Chat users in the network will join one common chat channel(#Main). However, users are not limited to this one channel —. they cancreate as many new channels as desired and initiate private discussionson completely private channels. Users can also send messages at anytime to other online “.buddies”. (all users are visible who have VypressChat running in your network). Users can send and receive instantmessages and begin chatting immediately after installation. <br />
<br />
<strong>Research &amp;. Development Pays Off</strong><br />
<br />
We created Vypress Chat after studying how busy professionals use theircomputers and networks in actual working environments. As a result ofthese studies, during development we concentrated on usefulness,efficiency and simplicity. The result? Vypress Chat’.s interface isattractive, simple-to-use and customizable, and Vypress Chat offers youfeatures similar to the best aspects found in our competitor’.sapplications. You get an interface comparable to mIRC’.s graphical IRCinterface, and system tray functionality similar to that of ICQ. <br />
