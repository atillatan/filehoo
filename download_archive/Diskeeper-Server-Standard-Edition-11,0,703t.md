<p><font size="2">Diskeeper Server Standard Edition is the secret to maximum speed and uptime.<br />
With files being constantly created, modified and deleted, diskfragmentation on your servers builds up with alarming rapidity—.soquickly, in fact, that it can begin to cause problems within a matterof hours. Backups and virus scans take longer. The server bogs downunder high loads. It may even crash without warning—.and take anextraordinarily long time to reboot. <br />
<br />
Ideally, servers should be defragmented daily, but doing so presents atricky problem. How do you defragment without interrupting the server sworkflow? The answer is simple: Diskeeper 10 Server Standard Edition.Diskeeper features "Set It and Forget It"™. technology that allows it towork in the background, so that it can defragment the server while it sup and running.<br />
<br />
NEW! Diskeeper 10 introduces breakthrough I-FAAST™. technology (Intelligent File Access AccelerationSequencing Technology), poised to revolutionize data access performanceon Windows Server platforms worldwide. I-FAAST improves file access andcreation by up to 80% (average 10%-20%).<br />
<br />
Using specially-engineered benchmarks Diskeeper learns disk performancecharacteristics, and then transparently monitors volumes over time forfile access frequency applying proprietary techniques to preventDiskeeper from being "fooled" by files that have been recentlyaccessed. During special I-FAAST defragmentation jobs, Diskeeperorganizes the most commonly used files and applications to increasefile access performance. Like other intelligent technologies featuredin Diskeeper 10, I-FAAST can automatically adapt to changing usagepatterns—.so there s no need to reconfigure if the system is reassignedto another purpose.<br />
<br />
End result: Optimized performance and reliability 24/7. There s no downside!<br />
<br />
