<p><font size="2"><p>SpaceMan 99 is an utility to help organize files and manage disk space.<br />
<br />
It shows the total disk space used by all folders, and finds duplicatefiles and folders. It also has special commands to help deleteduplicate files safely. SpaceMan 99 has a report generator that canproduce summary reports showing folder sizes and listing all duplicatefiles.<br />
<br />
SpaceMan 99 uses a Windows Explorer like interface, and is very quick and easy to use. SpaceMan 99 can show both the sum of allthe file sizes under each folder, and the total disk space used by allthe files. The disk space used can often be considerably higher thanjust the sum of the file sizes, especially if you have lots of smallfiles.<br />
<br />
Using SpaceMan 99 to find duplicate files is a very good way of findingfiles to delete to make more disk space. SpaceMan 99 provides fullcontrol over how duplicate files are found. If you need 100% certainty,SpaceMan 99 can do a full byte by byte comparison between files. <br />
<br />
If you want faster results, and are willing to accept a very slightrisk that two files might be reported as duplicates when they are infact different, SpaceMan 99 can just compare file checksums. Inaddition, SpaceMan 99 has options to control whether the filenames orfile modification dates must also match for files to be reported asduplicates.<br />
<br />
SpaceMan 99 also has file and folder filters that can be used to speed up scans or customize the file reports.<br />
<br />
SpaceMan 99 has comprehensive context-sensitive help, and comes with afull manual in PDF format (this requires Adobe Acrobat Reader to view).<br />
