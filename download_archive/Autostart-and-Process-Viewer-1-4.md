Manage your startup programs, and view or terminate runing processes <br />
Autostart and Process Viewer is an application that allows you to view the currently running processes, and to view and remove the autostart entries. <br />
<br />
But the most important thing is that you can "accept" the processes and autostart entries, and if a new one appears - you will be notified about it. <br />
<br />
Why? Simply because most trojans and viruses put themselves to the autostart, andor, must run as a process, all of this without your knowledge (unless you have this program installed:). <br />
<br />
Of course having a good anti-virus and anti-trojans software is a must, but the key problem is that a certain trojanvirus may not be detected by this programs yet (for example because a trojan is new, and the databases of anti-trojan programs are not yet aware of them). <br />
