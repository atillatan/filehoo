Award-winning PartitionMagic Pro from Symantec is a leader in hard-drive partitioning software. PartitionMagic Pro allows you to create, resize, move, and convert partitions without destroying your data.

You can convert NTFS files to either FAT or FAT32 partitions, merge FAT and FAT 32 partitions, and convert primary partitions to logical partitions and vice versa.Includes support for FAT, FAT32, Linux ext 2, Linux SWAP, NTFS, and HPFS partitions. In addition, you can view comprehensive information about your hard disk geometry and hardware system, and resize your root directories. <br />
