<p><font size="2">FineCrypt allows you to create encrypted self-extracting archives whichcan be decrypted without it. FineCrypt lets you encrypt files,directories and whole directory trees using a password or a key. It isvery easy to use.<br />
<br />
<strong>10 encryption algorithms</strong><br />
<br />
You can choose for encrypting any of 10 encryption algorithms: AES,Blowfish, CAST-256, GOST, IDEA, MARS, RC-6, Serpent, Triple-DES andTwofish. also you can use any of four encryption modes: ElectronicCodebook, Cipher Block Chaining, Cipher Feedback and Output Feedback.<br />
<br />
The program includes a key manager, the ability to display filestatistics, a permanent file wiping function, and integration with theWindows shell.<br />
<br />
<strong>Creating strongly encrypted file archives</strong><br />
<br />
You can encrypt several files either into single encrypted archive orinto different encrypted files. With FineCrypt archives you can work inthe same way as you work with zip archives: you can add to or removefiles from archive , decrypt desired files, and modify file "in-place"not removing it from archive.<br />
<br />
<strong>Creating encrypted self-extracting executables</strong><br />
<br />
With FineCrypt you can create encrypted and non-encryptedself-extracting executable files. You can send such files to people whohaven t FineCrypt on theirs computers and they will be able to decrypt this file.<br />
<br />
<strong>Check for absolute correctness of encryption</strong><br />
<br />
FineCrypt is the ONLY encryption program that you can check by yourselffor absolute correctness of encryption: how to check FineCrypt.<br />
<br />
<strong>Encrypting with encryption key or with password</strong><br />
<br />
You can provide for the encryption your own encryption key, which willbe used for encryption without any further transformation. Mostexisting encryption products perform the encryption with a keygenerated from the user s password. The user does not even see the keythat is used for encryption of confidential information. FineCryptmakes it possible to perform encryption both with the password and withthe key specified by the user. <br />
<br />
<strong>Secure exchanging encrypted files and encryption keys with other users</strong><br />
<br />
FineCrypt Communicator lets you securely communicate with other usersof FineCrypt via Internet. Using Communicator you can exchange youencryption keys and encrypted files with other users. Communicatorprotects your communication with the help of the Public Key Encryption.<br />
<br />
<strong>Encrypting files and folders with one mouse click</strong><br />
<br />
Quick Encrypt feature lets you encrypt files and folders, createencrypted archives and add new files to an existing archive with justone mouse click. Quick Encrypt not only saves your time, but itautomatically does for you almost all work with encryption keys. Allyou need is to specify directory where you store encryption keys. Infact, Quick Encrypt lets you not to care about passwords and encryptionkeys at all (except of providing physical safety for a media whereencryption keys are stored).<br />
<br />
<strong>Full integration with Windows shell</strong><br />
<br />
You can encrypt files in three ways: by choosing Encrypt... fromWindows context menu, which appears when you click right mouse buttonon file or folder. by dragging the file you want to encrypt ontoFineCrypt s icon on the desktop. or from main FineCrypt window. You candecrypt files from the Windows Explorer simply by double clicking theleft mouse button on the file you want to decrypt. or by draggingencrypted file onto FineCrypt s icon on the desktop.<br />
<br />
<strong>Statistical analysis</strong><br />
<br />
Using the "File statistics" feature you can get the values of somestatistic indicators related to the data stored in the file. Forexample, if you have used a program for file encryption and you cannottest it with the help of test vectors, then you can get an idea aboutthe quality of encryption by analyzing the characteristics of theciphertext produced by this program. In the main FineCrypt windowselect a file about which you want to get statistics and after thatpress Ctrl+Enter or choose menu item File statistics in menu Actions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Secure deletion of files</strong><br />
<br />
Using the "Wipe" utility you can permanently delete the file content soit cannot be retrieved using disk recovery software. You canpermanently delete files with the "Wipe" utility in two ways: from theWindows Explorer context menu, or from main FineCrypt window.<br />
<br />
<strong>Key management</strong><br />
<br />
With Key Manager you can easily manage you encryption keys andencrypted files. One of the main requirements that has to be met forencryption is a frequent key change. The number of keys grows rapidlyso that the user has to maintain a key database and keep count of whatkey is used for what file. In FineCrypt for the first time we have usedtechnology developed and patented by Crypto Systems that makes itpossible to assign a unique key ID to each key and to store this IDwith the file. Thus without any compromise of security there is no needto maintain a separate key database. The keys should be kept in onelocation and FineCrypt will automatically find the required key beforedecryption. See for more details: Overview of key</font></p></p>
