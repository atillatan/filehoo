<strong>You need the Ultimate Boot CD if you want to:</strong><br />
<br />
- Run floppy-based diagnostic tools from CDROM drives. More and morePCs are shipped without floppy drives these days, and it is such aroyal pain when you need to run diagnostic tools on them. <br />
<br />
- Free yourself from the slow loading speed of the floppy drive. Evenif you do have a floppy drive, it is still much much faster to run yourdiagnostic tools from the CDROM drive, rather than wait for the tool toload from the floppy drive. <br />
<br />
- Consolidate as many diagnostic tools as possible into one bootableCD. Wouldn t you like to avoid digging into the dusty box to look forthe right floppy disk, but simply run them all from a single CD? Thenthe Ultimate Boot CD is for you! <br />
<br />
- When you boot up from the CD, a text-based menu will be displayed,and you will be able to select the tool you want to run. The selectedtool actually boots off a virtual floppy disk created in memory.<br />
<br />
<strong>Full Version:</strong> The full version contains all the tools found inthe basic version but also adds the INSERT environment, a Linuxdistribution based on Knoppix. INSERT contains many utilities for theLinux user, such as the ability to mount most filesystems (includingNTFS(rw) via Captive), ssh and sshfs which allows you to mount afilesystem over ssh, Samba client and server, IDS and testing toolssuch as Nessus and Snort, Rdesktop to remote control Windows servers,VNC, Qtparted for re-partitioning, iptables, and Monkey webserver arejust a few of the tools found on the UBCD version</p></p></p>
