<p><font size="2">The Sunbelt Kerio Personal Firewall helps control how computers shareinformation with other computers through the Internet or a localnetwork. It also protects computers from external or internal attacksfrom other computers. The Personal Firewall is especially useful forlaptop computers since they are easier to compromise because ofbuilt-in wireless access.<br />
<br />
Basically, a firewall is a program that protects one computer fromother computers. It examines information that tries to enter a computerfrom an outside source (i.e. the internet), and determines if the information is safe or harmful.<br />
