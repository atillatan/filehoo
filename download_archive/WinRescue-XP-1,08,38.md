<p><font size="2"><p>Four Utilities in One: Crash Fixer, RegPack, File Backup, and Troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
WinRescue protects your computer from crashes. Don t spend hoursreinstalling Windows XP, restore in minutes with WinRescue XP. Defragthe Registry with RegPack. Backup the registry, important files, andany other files that you select. Get quick access to WindowsTroubleshooters.<br />
<br />
A Backup Wizard and Restore Wizard take the inexperienced user step-by-step through these processes.<br />
<br />
The Crash Fixer quickly restores the Registry, eleven important files, the Start Menu, the Desktop, Favorites, Send To, NetHood, Application Data, and Recent items. It supports Multiple Users. <br />
<br />
WinRescue XP is a security software that allows you to protect your PC.<br />
<br />
An XP Boot Disk can be made that boots to WinXP (if boot files becomecorrupted). A DOS Boot Disk can be made which boots to DOS and runs theDOS version of WinRescue XP (if Windows XP will not start). The DOSBoot Disk can also be used as a repair disk with the WinXP CD.<br />
<br />
RegPack defrags (removes blanks and reorders) the Registry. Many timesthis speeds up Windows. Without the RegPack process, the registry willnever get smaller. It works with Multiple Users. Undo RegPack with theclick of a button.<br />
<br />
File Backup allows the Registry, default files, and any or all files tobe backed up. Use WinRescue XP Explorer-like window or wildcards tospecify files to include or exclude from the Backup. WinRescue backs upto the harddrive, to CD, to diskette, to zip drive, or to mappedNetwork Drives.<br />
<br />
The Extractor extracts individual files from a backup. Backup types areFull, Incremental (back up files that have changed since Full orIncremental Backup), Differential (back up files that have changedsince Full Backup), and Replace.<br />
<br />
Backup automatically daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly or useWindows Task Scheduler. Backups can be protected by a password.<br />
<br />
WinRescue XP works only with WindowsXP. Use other versions of WinRescue for other versions of Windows.<br />
