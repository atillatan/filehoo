<p><font size="2"><p>Create Virtual Drives from long paths, it s easy! Type the full path or(even easier) browse to the path via the Drive and Folder Lists. Turnlong paths into letters with Virtual Drive Creator ! <br />
<br />
Choose a drive letter from the "Available Virtual Drive Letters" listand Click [Add Virtual Drive] to create the Virtual Drive, or DoubleClick the letter to create the Virtual Drive. <br />
<br />
It s just as easy to remove a Virtual Drive, Double Click the letteryou want removed as a Virtual Drive or Click the letter and then Click[Remove Virtual Drive]. <br />
<br />
Make CD-ROMs obsolete: Copy the contents of a CD-ROM to a folder, not the root directory, on your Hard Drive.Make that folder a Virtual Drive (see paragraph above), then installthe Virtual CD from the Virtual Drive letter. <br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the space provided type L:setup or L:install(substitute your Virtual Drive letter for L and see the documentationthat came with your CD-ROM for the proper installation command). <br />
<br />
Now every time you need to access the CD you can use the Virtual CDfrom your hard drive. Be sure to make note of the Virtual Drive letteryou used to create the Virtual CD, when you reboot your computer youwill need to re-create the Virtual Drive using the same letter. (Withthe Pro Version of Virtual Drive Creator you can make your VirtualDrives Permanent!)<br />
<br />
Virtual Drive Creator (VDC) performs the DOS SUBST command from withinWindows. This allows you to use a drive letter to specify a completedirectory path (d:foldersub1sub2etc).<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Limitations:</strong></span><br />
<br />
Virtual Drive Creator™. (basic) is free. Virtual Drive Creator™. - Prosells for $14.95. They only difference between the basic and Proversions is the Pro version will offer the option to make the virtualdrive permanent and the basic version will test your system to see ifit is capable of performing the required instruction to make thevirtual drive permanent.<br />
What this all means is when you download and use VDC there will be notime limit, nor will you be nagged to purchase the Pro version (the"Buy Now" buttons are not nags, they are there for your convenience).<br />
