<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>Prevent the installation of spyware, adware and other potentially unwanted software!<br />
<br />
SpywareBlaster doesn t scan and clean for so-called spyware - it prevents it from being installed in the first place.<br />
<br />
It achieves this by disabling the CLSIDs of popular spyware ActiveXcontrols, and also prevents the installation of any of them via awebpage. <br />
<br />
This allows you to run Internet Explorer with Active-X enabled, but itwill never download or even prompt you for any of the known ActiveXcontrols. All other Active-X controls or plug-ins will work fine. <br />
<br />
The SpywareBlaster database contains information on these known spywareActive-X controls and can be updated with the click of a button.<br />
<br />
The application windows displays a list of all controls that it is able to detect (this is not a list of whatwas found on your computer). SpywareBlaster cannot detect if you haveany of the known objects already installed, but if you do, they will bedisabled.<br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff">SpywareBlaster provides additional functionality inits "Tools" section. A short description of each of the Tools can befound below:</font> <br />
<br />
<strong>Browser Pages:</strong> This displays many of the "browser pages" on yoursystem (for example, your homepage, various search pages, etc.) andprovides the functionality to change any of them. Pages are displayedfor both Internet Explorer and Mozilla. <br />
<br />
<strong>Hosts Safe:</strong> The Hosts Safe can store encrypted backup copies orsnapshots of the Hosts file. These backup copies are stored in theSpywareBlaster folder. Should you ever need to restore a backup copy ofyour hosts file, simply select it from the displayed list and press the"Restore Saved Backup" button. <br />
<br />
<strong>Misc. Internet Explorer Settings:</strong> Here you can edit a few Internet Explorer settings that are not readily available through any built-in interface in IE. <br />
<br />
<strong>Flash Killer:</strong> Macromedia Flash can be used to display animatedinterfaces on websites, animations, and other "Flash" content.Unfortunately, advertisers have begun to use Flash as a method forcreating annoying and distracting content. And some users that wish tokeep Flash off of their computers altogether have found it troublesometo prevent every website that uses Flash from installing it. FlashKiller can set the kill bit for the Macromedia Flash control (versions4.x, 5.x, or 6.x) - preventing the installation completely anddisabling it if it is already installed. Reversing this procedure iseasy. <br />
<br />
<strong>Custom Blocking:</strong> Create your own list of ActiveX controls thatyou want to block. Add search engine toolbars, browser plug-ins, andmore - block any ActiveX control you want. You can even download CustomBlocking lists other people have created. (Warning: Please be carefulwhen using a Custom Blocking list someone else has created. Onlyconsider using a Custom Blocking list if you trust the person thatcreated it.) <br />
<br />
<strong>SpywareBlaster is freeware for personal and educational use.</strong></p></p></p>
