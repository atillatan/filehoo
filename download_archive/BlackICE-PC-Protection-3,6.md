BlackICE's Application Protection quickly and invisibly defeats dangerous programs that attackers deliver through instant messaging, email, or even your Web browser! BlackICE stops these destructive programs before they do harm-like damaging your PC or launching email attacks against your friends and co-workers. <br />
<br />

and blocks attacks through a comprehensive inspection of all inbound and outbound information to your computer. And BlackICE PC Protection is constantly working to secure your dial-up, DSL, and cable modem from hackers 24 hours a day, every day of the year. <br />

ISS highly recommends that you perform a full virus/Trojan scan of your system before installing BlackICE™ PC Protection to keep destructive applications out of your trusted applications database. <br />
<br />
Please note: We recommend that you uninstall your BlackICE Product BEFORE you upgrade to any Windows operating system. BIRemove.exe will delete all files and folders in the folder that BlackICE is installed in. If you installed BlackICE in its default folder, BIRemove.exe will work as expected. <br />
<br />
If non-BlackICE programs or files are stored in the default BlackICE folder, move them before running this program or they will be deleted too. If you installed BlackICE into any folder other than its default folder, your safest option for uninstalling is to use Add/Remove Programs. <br />
