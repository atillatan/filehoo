<p><font size="2">BearShare is a file sharing program that lets you, your friends, and everyone in the world share files. Built on Gnutella technology, it provides a simple, easy to use interface combined with a powerful connection and search engine that puts thousands of different files in easy reach. It is designed to let you share files with everyone on the Internet, and download files that other people are sharing. Works with all types of files, and lets you search for files that contain specific words or phrases.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">BearShare is a popular Gnutella-based file sharing application originally created by Free Peers, Inc.. It runs under Microsoft Windows and comes in several versions, including an advertising supported version, a paid Pro version with no advertisements, and a Lite (stripped down) free version. The advertising-supported version has been criticised in the past for bundling spyware applications as a revenue stream. <br />
