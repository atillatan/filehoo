<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">Boot Editor is an editor to create boot screens for Windows XP.<br />
It can also change the default palette of boot screens and the position of the progress bar.<br />
<br />
<strong>Changes</strong> in Current Version:<br />
<br />
First, thanks to swissboy for all the help.<br />
<br />
&lt;.&gt;. Full Support for bitmaps #4 - "Progress bar (Other)", #12 -"Overlay (Embedded)", #13 - "Overlay (Server Family)", #16 - "Overlay(.net)", #17 - "Overlay (Tablet PC Edition)" and #18 - "Overlay (MediaCenter Edition)".<br />
Relative options at Main screen and at dialog “.Make a new Boot exe file”.<br />
&lt;.&gt;. Now, a user can load the kernel file version that wants inBootEditor. Right click in a folder (screen) at the “.Availiable boot screens”. tree and you will see a menu with all“.ntoskrnl*.exe”. files that are in that folder. Select the one you wantand BootEditor will load this file always for all folders.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
We have the folder (screen) “.matrix”. and inside we have the files“.ntoskrnl.exe”. and “.ntoskrnlSP1.exe”.. If we right click in folder“.matrix”. we see a menu with the 2 files. If we select the“.ntoskrnlSP1.exe”. file, BootEditor will load that file and if we selectan other folder still will try to load this file from the activefolder. If in a folder there is not a “.ntoskrnlSP1.exe”. file, will tryto load the classic “.ntoskrnl.exe”. file.<br />
&lt;.&gt;. At dialog “.Make a new Boot exe file”., under the check box“.First, copy a clean kernel file ….”., now you can select what file youwant to update. There, is a combo box with all the “.ntoskrnl*.exe”.files that are located in program’.s folder.<br />
<br />
Also, we can check the box “.All”. and program will create all thefiles that are inside program’.s folder with the active bitmaps (oneclick to create all kernell versions)<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Inside program’.s folder we have the files “.ntoskrnl.exe”. and“.ntoskrnlSP1.exe”.. In the combo there we can see the 2 files and we canselect what file we want to update, or we can check the “.All”. andprogram will create all the files.<br />
&lt;.&gt;. Now, you can save the bitmaps in Run Length Encoding (RLE)format or in classic RGB format. RLE format compress the bitmaps and itis better. You can select the method you want if you right click atbuttons “.Save”. and/or “.Save All”.. A relative option at dialog “.Make anew Boot exe file”.. <br />
&lt;.&gt;. Until now, if a folder had subfolders, was a category (you cannot select that folder and load a kernel file). Now, if a folder hassubfolders, but inside there is the file “.ntoskrnl.exe”., you can selectthe file normally and load any “.ntoskrnl*.exe”. file that is there.<br />
&lt;.&gt;. New options at dialog Options<br />
&lt;.&gt;. Must say it all, thanks.</font></p></p>
