<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>SFV Checker is a useful program which ensures that your multi-volume file archives are complete and accurate!<br />
<br />
SFV Checker uses CRC-32 technology to check each file and notifies youof any potentially bad, corrupt, incorrect size or missing files tosave you hours of downloading only to find you have 1 file missing orthe last file has a CRC checksum error.<br />
<br />
The CRC value comparison is done by using a standard SFV file. If anSFV file is not available, you can drag and drop the file into the listview to produce the calculated CRC value. An informative report log is generated after file scanning thatprovides a list of missing and inconsistent files, as well as, asummary for the archive. <br />
SFV Checker can also concatenate files in the list and rename multiarchives on the fly, e.g. Correct file naming for .001, .002, .003files into .rar, .r00, r01 files.<br />
