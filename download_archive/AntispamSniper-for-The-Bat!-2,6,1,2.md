<p><font size="2">AntispamSniperfor The Bat! provides a bullet-proof anti-spam protection for yourmailbox. The unique combination of several methods for automatic </font><font size="2">email</font><font size="2"> classification shows impressive filtering quality. <br />
<br />
The statistical trainable classification algorithm has unique characteristics. <br />
<br />
AntispamSniper for The Bat! will learn your private correspondence,extract the distinguishing features from messages of different classesand use that information for effective analysis of other incomingmessages. The algorithm improves its classification qualitycontinuously with each new learned message.<br />
<br />
The messages from whitelisted senders are not filtered by other methodsand recognized as non-spam at once. The whitelist is updated onlearning automatically.<br />
<br />
The filtering rules are recognizing spam and ham by specificcombinations of symbols in a body and headers of the email messages.The rules are optional, because the trained algorithm and a whitelist are very effective. But the accurately assembledlists of rules may improve the classification quality in cases when thealgorithm is unable to select a certain class for a message with highprobability.<br />
<br />
Exceptions are the empirical conditions for filtering. For example,large messages are probably non-spam. The presence of certain types ofattached files also can be a good sign for recognizing message asnon-spam.<br />
<br />
The filtering log allows you to track back the history of classifying messages and training the plug-in.<br />
<br />
