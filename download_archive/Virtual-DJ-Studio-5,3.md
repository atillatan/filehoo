<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>Virtual DJ Studio (VDJ) is an MP3 Mixer for live DJ performances. <br />
<br />
With Virtual DJ Studio you can play Karaoke with Multiple MonitorSupport, Mix MP3 Files, use multiple Sound Cards, and adjust Pitch andTempo on each file individually. <br />
<br />
VDJ also contains a full 10-band Graphic Equalizer , full support for Audio Plugins, a Spectrum Analyzer, and many more tools for DJs.<br />
<br />
Virtual DJ Studio is not like all of the other DJ programs out there.While other programs limit you to two players with a Cross-Fader,Virtual DJ Studio provides you with an entire studio. <br />
<br />
The two-deck metaphor is out-dated. There is no reason to limit yourself when your PC can easily give you so much more. <br />
<br />
Now, with Virtual DJ Studio, you can break free from this tired metaphor! <br />
<br />
You will quickly see how VDJ is different from other DJ software. Laidout like a Mixer, each Line features a full MP3, WAV and Playlistplayer, with its own Volume Fader, Pitch/Tempo control, and more.<br />
