<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>Ignitionis a file organizer tool that minimizes the number of CD s required toburn a large number of files. Ignition - CD burning optimizer.<br />
<br />
The "burn" features require VSO s CopyToCD</a> to work.<br />
<br />
For example if your backup fits on 3-4 CDs, a manual files organizationmight lead on a 4th with only 10 Mb of data when a better organizationwould have only required 3 CDs. Thanks to Ignition, you ll save medias,time and money.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "Ignition":</strong></span><br />
<br />
Support 650,700 Mb CDs, HD Burn CDs and DVDs (even Dual Layer DVDs) <br />
Ability to create ISO images (requires CopyToDVD) <br />
Automatically create folders for each optimized CD or create a TXTfile that contains the optimized list of each CD s content. <br />
Ability to put a bunch of files on every media (autorun, codecs...) <br />
Ability to burn CDs/DVDs (requires CopyToDVD) <br />
Internationalization support.</p></p></p>
