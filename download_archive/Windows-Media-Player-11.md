<p><font size="2"><p>Windows Media Player is the multimedia software application developedby Microsoft that provides users with the ability to view multimediacontent, both from their hard drive and from the Internet. <br />
<br />
Windows Media Player 10 gives you more music and more choices, and forthe first time makes it possible to sync high-quality music, video, andphotos to the latest portable devices.<br />
<br />
<em>Overall, Windows Media Player 10 is a huge improvement over previous Windows Media Player versions, though </em><em>it still falls short of the competition in a few key areas. <br />
<br />
If you ve bought into the Microsoft-oriented music world in any way,however--perhaps with a Media Center PC, Portable Media Center device,or by using a WMA-compatible online music service--you simply mustupgrade to WMP 10. <br />
<br />
This release offers major improvements for discovering and buying, andsubscribing to content online, sports an improved UI, and integratesnicely with a coming generation of portable devices. <br />
<br />
And if up-and-coming music subscription services, like that now offeredby Napster, take off, the release of WMP 10 will be heralded as thewatershed moment of what is clearly still a nascent market. <br />
<br />
That said, users interested solely in music playback will likely findlittle reason to abandon iTunes. And iPod users will simply ignore WMP10 as they have previous versions.<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player 10 is free and requires Windows XP (any edition), but not any other Windows versions. <br />
<br />
That decision will be controversial, but I think it s the right one:With over 300 million users, XP is clearly the preferred Windows clientfor consumers and music enthusiasts: Had Microsoft shipped a WMP 10version for older Windows versions, that product would have lacked keyfeatures and held up the release of the XP version.</em><br />
