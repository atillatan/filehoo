<br />
When you want to compress your files, you should be looking for a tool that offers excellent performance in three categories: <br />
compression ratio <br />
compression speed <br />
ease-of-use <br />
<br />
A compression tool that crunches the last free bit from your data, buttakes twice to ten times longer for compressing and - even worse - forextracting your data probably will not work for you - or yourcustomers. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, a compression tool that deflates your files as quickas lightning but leaves a lot of "air" in the compressed file will nottake you far either. <br />
<br />
So you are most likely looking for a versatile tool that <br />
blends both compression speed and power in an intuitive interface <br />
gives you quick and convenient access to your archives during your everyday work <br />
but also allows you to use all the extra features for professionalfile distribution - like password protection, disk-spanning archives orthe possibility to create self-extracting archives? <br />
<br />
Well, look no further. We would like to invite you to take a closer look at WinAce, the new companion for your archiving needs.<br />
<br />
<br />
WinAce is a 32-Bit GUI (Windows95/98/ME/NT 4.x/2000/XP) for the new and widely popular compression format ACE. <br />
<br />
The program s main purpose is to provide the user with a means to create, modify or extract compressed files of different types.<br />
<br />
In addition to the Windows version there is a DOS version availablewhich also includes an easy-to-use shell and several commandlineversions for various operating systems (DOS, Win32 and OS/2 as of 6/99).<br />
<br />
The compression features of WinAce are not limited to ACE alone - otherpopular formats, like the common and widely used ZIP format can be bothused for compression and extraction of data files.<br />
<br />
Since handling archives is very similar to handling files anddirectories, WinAce can also be used as a file manager shell. Itsupports operations like copying, moving or deleting files as well asviewing text and commonly used graphic files.<br />
<br />
WinAce achieves very high compression rates using the ACE format without sacrificing compression speed.<br />
<br />
The ACE compression also offers easier handling of multi-volume (aka"disk spanning") archives and a more efficient compression algorithmcompared to the ZIP-Format. The use of solid compression improves thecompression rates even more, especially when used on data contained ina large number of (small) files.<br />
<br />
Due to the high distribution of ZIP files around the globe, the ZIPformat is also fully supported - although ZIP lacks the powerful andfast compression ACE has to offer.<br />
<br />
WinAce is very easy to use! To open an archive linked with WinAce youonly need to doubleclick it in any shell environment, like theMicrosoft Explorer. When running WinAce, archives may also be browsedfor and/or opened by using the File/Open command.<br />
<br />
Archives opened with WinAce are handled like ordinary directories. Thisbasically means that archive files can be opened or displayed by theinternal viewer by doubleclicking on the archive name.<br />
<br />
WinAce has full Drag&amp;.Drop support. Files may ba dragged to analready existing archive or from an archive to another folder or ontothe desktop. During the compression/extraction process a status windowkeeps you informed about the file(s) currently processed.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "WinAce":</strong></span><br />

multi-volume (disk spanning) archives for ACE, ZIP, CAB <br />
