<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">Feurio is an integrated program for creating audio-CDs (especially samplers). <br />
<br />
Feurio! contains an "audio grabbing" (digital extraction of audio-datafrom an audio-cd) program, a CD-database (including CDDB-support), aCD- and wave-player, a sample wave-editor and (of course) a CD-burningprogram.<br />
<br />
<span class="articleDetailsLink"><strong>Features:</strong></span><br />
<br />
A powerful Audio Grabber: In Feurio! there s an integrated powerfultool for reading audio CDs digitally. The grabbing program can beadjusted to work with several CD-Roms using many parameters. so withalmost all CD-Roms you can read CD-Roms with the maximum possible speed(e.g. reading audio with a speed of 15 times is no problem).<br />
If you wish, the pauses at the beggining and the end of a track can be deleted automaticly.<br />
Real Multitasking: Feurio! has real multitasking: While burning aCD, the next CD can be read. If you have more than one CD-Rom, data canbe read from multiple CDs at the same time. during reading the tracksalready read can be edited. <br />
Integrated project management: Feurio! manages any number ofprojects (=CDs). Individual tracks can be freely copied to and from theprojects, also the oder of the tracks can be modified easily. Inaddition Feurio! can handle wave files on the harddisc. <br />
A very robust CD Writer: Using Windows NT it is in practice, if thesystem is configured correctly (right SCSI-Bus priorities, disconnectactivated, no drivers that block the system too long), impossible, togenerate a "Buffer-Underrun".<br />
For myself, in the meantime I m burning only in the background, andeven during biggest actions in the foreground (printing, surfing in the internet, copying big files, loading a 100MB file into theeditor, defragmenting the harddisc...) a wasn t able to generate a"Buffer Underrun".<br />
Using Windows 95 it s also possible to continue the work whenburning, but there you may not cause heavy swapping operations to theharddisc.<br />
The CD Writer need just about 4% of CPU time (Basis: 166 Mhz Pentium)<br />
(This is just valid when using SCSI CD Writers resp. IDE Writers with Busmaster drivers) <br />
Writing on multiple CD-Writers at the same time is possible (evendifferent CDs): Feurio! is capable of writing to multiple CD-Writersat the same time, even different CDs can be burned at the same time(recommended only for Windows NT, fast harddisc is needed). You needthe Professional Version of Feurio! for this<br />
CD Database: Feurio! also manages your CD collection <br />
CDDB Database Support: An audio CD doesn t contain the titles of theCD and the tracks. normally for every CD unknown to Feurio you wouldhave to type these information into Feurio!. The CDDB database in adatabase on the internet, that contains the titles of CD and tracks ofthousands of CDs.<br />
"Virtual CD Player": This player plays the arranged CDs of a projectexactly as the later burned CD would sound (incl. thepauses/transitions) <br />
Track Editor: The Track Editor is a simple wave editor. With thiseditor you can e.g. remove/cut the silence at the beginning or end of atrack or insert fade-ins and fade-outs. Furthermore you can adjust theamplitude of the tracks.<br />
The great advantage in contrast to a normal wave editor is, that theFeurio! Track Editor directly works together with the Feurio! CDWriter: All actions will be done "on the fly", i.e. only theinformation about the start and end positions, the fadings, theamplitude, etc. will be transferred to the Feurio! CD Writer and thecorresponding actions will be done while burning (so the wave fileremains untouched).<br />
Because of this the wave file doesn t have to be re-saved, so timewill be saved. Furthermore the modifications can be undone at any time.<br />
Last but not least, Feurio! creates, when reading the tracks thefirst time, an "overview file", so that the track editor doesn t needto read in the whole wave file when starting (which means that furthertime is saved).<br />
MP3 Support: When a MP3 Codec is installed on your system, Feurio!can work with MP3 files directly (e.g. Wave Player or Wave Editor). Inparticular, these files can be burned directly to CD (withoutdecompressing them).<br />
If you have installed a "professional version" of the codec or theBladeEncoder, you can also create MP3 files. You can either compressexisting wave files, or you can directly read tracks from a CD in theMP3-format. <br />
CD-Text Support: Feurio! can (provided that you have an appropriateCD-Rom or CD-Writer) read CD-Text-informations (i.e. read the data onthe CD), copy CD-Text-CDs or create your own CD-Text-CDs (i.e. you canwrite any text to the CD). Also you can "change" a "non-CD-Text"-CD toa "CD-Text"-CD. <br />
Splitting wave/tracks Files<br />
When e.g. you are recording a LP into your computer, you can firstdigitalise a complete side of the LP and store it as a wave file,afterwards you can split this file into several track with the Feurio!Wave Editor, without the need for splitting the file into several files.<br />
Automatic Adjustment of the amplitude of the tracks (of course manual adjustment is also possible!) <br />
Works with joined tracks (e.g. in live recordings) <br />
Pauses between the tracks can be modified <br />
Pays attention to the "Pre-Emphasis-Flag" <br />
Displays the filling state of the recorder buffer (if your recorder supports this, see the page: "CD-Writer Database") <br />
"Overburning" of CD blanks For many CD-Writers (look at: "CD-WriterDatabase") it is possible, to burn more data to a blank than the"official" playing time of this blank. So a 74-minutes-blank can oftenbe written with up to 78 minutes.<br />
The results of "overburning tests" (i.e. the maximum playing time ofseveral blanks) you can read at the page "Maximum capacity of blanks".<br />
Further Feurio! has a special test mode, with which you candetermine the maximum capacity of CD blanks. The values determined willthen be stored in a database, so that the maximum playing time can beshown, when later another blank of this type in inserted. <br />
Specially adapted to Windows NT: Feurio! is specially adapted forWindows NT 4.0 . By using some special calls (e.g. setting thepriority of the burning thread, locking the buffer memory, etc.) it canbe ensured, that a Buffer-Underrun is hardly possible, even if thecomputer is very busy! <br />
Cover Editor: Feurio! contains a Cover Editor, with which a coverfor the created CD can be printed. (The Cover Editor isn t finishedyet, so at the moment just a standard cover can be printed. I will addcapabilities for editing the cover later).<br />
