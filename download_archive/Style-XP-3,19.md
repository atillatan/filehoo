<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>Style XP is not a skinning engine. It uses Microsoft s built-in visualstyle engine, but enhances it by providing many useful tools. Style XPcan import, select, rotate, and manage themes, visual styles,wallpapers, and logons. <br />
<br />
Future versions may support sounds, cursors, screensavers, and packagesof all the above. How does it work? Instead of lines and gradients, theXP user interface natively supports the use of skinned bitmap controls(a visual style). <br />
<br />
This is Microsoft s own innovation. Style XP includes its own visual styles.<br />
<br />
<font color="#ff0000"><strong>Supports Win XP SP2</strong></font><br />
<br />
<strong>MAKE SURE you back-up your system BEFORE try this app !</strong><br />
<br />
More Themes you can find at <strong>HERE</strong></a><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here </strong><strong>are some key features of "Style XP":</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong>Zero-Footprint Operation</strong><br />
Choose to have Style XP run in the system tray for easy management andselection of new styles, or turn Style XP off for zero-footprintoperation. No additional memory will be utilized unless you desire it. <br />
<br />
<strong>Native</strong><br />
Style XP skins are zero-footprint because they use the same VisualStyle Source that is built into XP. XP s Visual Style Engine will loadand draw our start button with the exact code used to load and draw theinfamous green start buttons of the original Blue, Olive Green, andSilver skins. <br />
This is done by performing an in memory patch to XP s Visual StyleEngine. Style XP does not use SetWindowsHookEx, which can noticeablyslow system performance. Nor does it hook the "Appearance" tab on theDisplay Properties property sheet.<br />
<br />
<strong>New Visual Styles, Wallpapers, Logons, and Themes</strong><br />
Try out our new "CoughDrop" visual style and color schemes."Toothpaste" and a community skin pack are also included. You candownload more visual styles for free from our Links Page. <br />
<br />
<strong>Accessibility &amp;. High-Resolution Functionality</strong><br />
Does your monitor operate at 1600x1200? How about 2048 x 1536? Perhaps you have a new LCD display. <br />
At these finer pixel resolutions, the display can exceed 100 DPI.StyleBuilder is designed to build skins which support the higher DPIresolutions so that window controls are easier to see.<br />
Since Style XP skins are native source styles, this useful XP functionality is present in its original and familiar form.<br />
<br />
<strong>Application Compatibility</strong><br />
Our native design allows us to enjoy the thousands of hours of work putin by Microsoft s UI team to ensure application compatibility. There isno list of incompatible applications to keep track of. <br />
<br />
<strong>Font Sizes</strong><br />
Like the original Microsoft Blue, Olive Green, and Silver VisualStyles, StyleBuilder &amp;. Style XP skins support three font sizesNormal, Large, and Extra Large. <br />
These larger font sizes are important, because they are used by the elderly and visually impaired.<br />
<br />
<strong>Easy Installation</strong><br />
The new Style XP install takes minutes to download and seconds to install. No reboot is required.</p></p></p>
