<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>WinAmpBar is a program, which adds the panel to your desktop, similarto taskbar, but on the WinAmpBar panel there are not application keys,but control elements of WinAmp player. <br />
<br />
Why is it? Sure, you see the situation, when you want to set on a new album, click pause to speak on the phone, to know track number or its length. <br />
<br />
For any operation you have to lose time to find Winamp window betweenother windows, activate it, open necessary windows, for example to addfolder to the playlist. But you don t want to distractâ€¦.<br />
<br />
There is WinAmp to help! Almost any operation takes one-two mouseclicks. WinAmpBar flexibly tunes to your wishes. Bar can stay on thetop, bottom of the screen, automatically popup (as taskbar in theautohide mode). Skin technology makes use of WinAmpBar not onlypractical, but aesthetic. There are 3 wab-skins in distributive.<br />
