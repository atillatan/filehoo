<p><font size="2">Simp (Secway`s Instant Messenger Privacy) is an application developed by Secway to provide security to your online MSN Messenger conversations. <br />
<br />
Simp works by encrypting messages before they are sent over the Internet and decrypting them when they arrive at your contacts. <br />
<br />
Once installed on your and your friends computer, Simp will prevent anyone from reading your conversations. Very GOOD !</font></p></p>
