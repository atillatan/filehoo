<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>Hotmail Popper is a little program that will allow you to check your Hotmail account from a normal POP mail client. <br />
<br />
Unlike standard mail accounts which allow users to retrieve their e-mail</a>through a POP mail client, Hotmail can normally only be checked on theWeb, or via Outlook Express. With this program you can use yourfavorite POP mail client to retrieve your e-mail from your Hotmailaccount. <br />
<br />
<font color="#ff4500"><strong>Please Note: </strong></font>Microsoft hasrecently decided that only paying members and existing valued memberswill be able access Hotmail using outside services such as HotmailPopper. Hotmail Popper will continue working with a "Hotmail Plus" (or equivalent MSN)account. It will also continue working if you have an older Hotmailaccount that Microsoft considers a valued account. <br />
<br />
<strong>Usage</strong><br />
<br />
First, run Hotmail Popper if it is not already running. There is nointerface to see most of the time, except for a small icon in yourTaskbar Notification Area. You can right-click on this icon to setoptions (see below), although most users will not need to change thesettings from their defaults. <br />
<br />
To configure your e-mail client, setup a new POP account to check mailfrom. For the POP server s address, type "127.0.0.1" (or if youmodified the Hotmail Popper options, use whatever you changed theaddress to). For the login / username for this account, use your fullHotmail address, for example "my_address@hotmail.com" or"mr_roboto@msn.com". <br />
<br />
Finally, your password will be the same as your normal Hotmailpassword. Please be aware that your password is case sensitive so becareful about which letters are capitals. this is not usually true whenlogging into your Hotmail account on the web, so be sure todouble-check this if your password is said to be invalid. <br />
<br />
Now just check your mail as usual. The account you just configured will retrieve your Hotmail messages! <br />
<br />
