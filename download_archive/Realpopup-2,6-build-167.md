<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>RealPopup replaces the old winpopup with a full featured freeware utility that remains simple and stable as its predecessor. <br />
<br />
RealPopup is compatible with system messenger services as well as oldwin9x and win3x system messaging tools, in other words it s fullyintegrated with your LAN environment. <br />
<br />
It support many useful features such as hypertexts, options for usersand groups, an internal network browser, names auto complete, systemtray, balloons and more. <br />
<br />
RealPopup is available in more than 12 languages for free.<br />
<br />
When you re using your computer, RealPopup stays silently on tray area(usually at lower-right corner, just near the clock). Once you receivea message, a balloon tip pops up and notify the event. you can fullycustomize this behavior, for example allowing RealPopup to produceballoons for certain people only, as well as immediately pop up theapplication itself for those important messages. <br />
<br />
You can also enable a message preview on the balloon itself, for all or certain people, or for thoseimportant messages. Conversely, you can completely ignore specificmessages or users groups, eventually saving important messages to atext file.<br />
<br />
Beside tons of options useful to customize your favorite messagingtool, RealPopup comes with the unique options set for users and groups:through a dedicated pane, you can associate an options set to specifiedgroups or single workstations and users. <br />
<br />
The defined items are browsed by RealPopup, getting options formatching workstations or users. through this powerful pane, you candefine rules such as log messages coming from the web server agent,ignore those printer spooler notifications, produce a balloon whenFrancesco is writing to me but immediately pop up when my boss sends mea message and so on. <br />
<br />
It s also possible to specify keywords associated with the items:RealPopup will match the item if any of the words are found in messagebody, allowing you to define context based rules. If you want to learnmore and get practiced with this feature, read a dedicated discussionwith provided examples. RealPopup comes with an extended localized helpfile with detailed info about all its features, behavior and options.<br />
<br />
<strong>Not only a local instant messenger</strong><br />
Generally, instant messengers are applications designed to work throughthe internet: they allow you to communicate with people everywhere,providing an internet connection. RealPopup is designed to communicatewith your local network computers. it doesn t require any network setupand no internet connection, as well as any application server: you justhave to install it and begin to communicate. <br />
<br />
RealPopup is really fast, because local network communications are notaffected by internet slowness. since it is designed to replace theWindows legacy messenger system (Windows messenger service, WinPopup orcompatible clients), you ll receive messages from printer spoolers, SQLServer, Windows Agents and the like, as well as NET SEND commandsissued by system administrators and their scripts.<br />
