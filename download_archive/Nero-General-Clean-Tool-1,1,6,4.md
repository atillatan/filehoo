<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2"><p>In some cases it can occur that you have to uninstall Nero or Nero related software (i.e. InCD...).<br />
Please use Nero General Clean Tool to do that and afterwards downloadand install the latest version of our software you were using.<br />
<br />
Please note: First make sure you have your Nero 5/6 serial number to install Nero/Nero Express with. It should look like<br />
15xx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx (Nero 5.x) or<br />
1Axx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx (Nero 6)<br />
It should be located on the inside of the Nero Jewel case, or on the back of the paper sleeve the Nero CD came in.<br />
You can also go into your Registry, and go to<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and under<br />
SOFTWARE_AHEAD_NERO-BURNING ROM_INFO<br />
obtain your Nero 5 or Nero 6 serial number from here.<br />
<br />
Please double click the EXE file to start the program. Select theoption: Clean All and then click on the "Clean Button". All Neroprograms will be uninstalled. After that please restart your computerso all registry entries will be removed.<br />
<br />
InCD 3.xx and InCD 4.xx can be removed completely under Win 9xx after a reboot.<br />
<br />
Also all the Plugins are removed with this tool. Please make sure youhave saved these files so you can re-install them afterwards.<br />
<br />

<br />
You are able to execute the CleanTool even when you have to start your computer in "Safe Mode".</p></p></p>
