<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">A port of the powerful ClamAV anti-virus software package from UNIX/Linux to Windows using the Cygwin compatibility layer <br />
ClamAV has been tweaked to the best while still maintaing complete compatibility with the original version, allowing unmatched compatibility with other apps that can use ClamAV. <br />
<br />
Like the original version, ClamAV/SOSDG is based on the GPL v2 license, which means it is free to download and use provided if you make any changes, that you contribute them back to the community. <br />
<br />
ClamAV features a command line interface for scanning files, updating the virus definitions, and a daemon for faster <br />
scanning needed on high performance systems. ClamAV is a security tool that protects your PC against viruses. <br />
<br />
Unlike most antivirus products, ClamAV requires no yearly subscription fee, and is completely free with source code to anyone who wishes to use it. <br />
<br />
The SOSDG has taken the latest ClamAV from the CVS tree, compiled it against the current stable Cygwin DLLs, which provide a full UNIX/Linux compatibility layer for Windows operating systems. <br />
<br />
Here are some key features of "ClamAV": <br />
<br />
· Command-line scanner <br />
· Fast, multi-threaded daemon <br />
· Filter interface for sendmail <br />
· Database updater with support for digital signatures <br />
· Virus scanner C library <br />
· On-access scanning (Linux and FreeBSD) <br />
· Detection of over 20000 viruses, worms and trojans <br />
· Built-in support for RAR (2.0), Zip, Gzip, Bzip2 <br />
· Built-in support for Mbox, Maildir and raw mail files </font></p></p>
