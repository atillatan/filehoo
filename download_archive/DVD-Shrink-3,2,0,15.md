<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">DVD Shrink is a software application that allows you to backup your DVDdisks. You can use this software in conjunction with DVD burningsoftware of your choice, to make a backup copy of any DVD video disk.<br />
<br />
DVD Shrink does not burn DVDs! The output from DVD Shrink is saved as files on your hard drive, which you can then burn to a DVD-R using separate burning software, such as the software provided with your DVD-R drive.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why Use DVD Shrink </strong>:<br />
Most DVD titles are designed to prevent you from making copies.<br />
<br />
The first preventative measure is encryption. Most DVD titles areencrypted, which prevents you from either copying them to your harddrive, or if you manage to do so, being able to play the resultingfiles. DVD Shrink overcomes this problem with built-in decryptionalgorithms.<br />
<br />
The next problem is not so easy. Most DVD video titles are simply toolarge to fit, without modification, onto a single recordable DVD-Rdisk. DVD Shrink overcomes this problem by modifying or "shrinking" thedata from your original DVD.<br />
<br />
DVD Shrink provides two ways of shrinking your DVD disk. These arere-authoring and re-encoding. You can use one, or the other, or formaximum "shrinkage", both combined.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, why use DVD Shrink? Because DVD Shrink is <strong>FREE</strong>!</font></p></p>
