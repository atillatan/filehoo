<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">EFTP stands for Encrypted File Transfer Protocol. Basically, it s the same as standard FTP (RFC 959), but with Encryption. <br />
<br />
Encrypted FTP is a software that allows you encrypt ftp transfer.<br />
<br />
EFTP uses a combination of Public Key encryption and Symmetric Keyencryption to allow fast and secure transfers over any TCP/IP network,including The Internet. <br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> EFTP cannot legally be used in France.<br />
<br />
EFTP is also able to work in non-encrypted mode with 3rd party FTP clients and servers, but to obtain the most secure level of </font><font size="2">data transfer</font><font size="2">, EFTP has to be used both at the client end and </font><font size="2">server</font><font size="2"> end.<br />
<br />
EFTP offers an easy to use graphical interface with user management, user groups, group administration and more. The server can be run as a strictly encrypted server, or like a regular FTPserver that allows connections from standard FTP clients as well. <br />
<br />
A small, standalone client is included with the download, that can beused to initiate a secure connection to EFTP obtain the most securelevel of data transfer. EFTP also includes several advanced featureslike IP restrictions, logging, banned user list and more.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are some key features of "Encrypted FTP":</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong>Secure Transfers </strong><br />
World standard and secure RSA encryption encodes the control channel,and Bruce Schneier s Blowfish encryption for data transfers. <br />
<br />
<strong>Secure SSL based Web Administration Portal </strong><br />
For easy access to basic server administration tools, including stopping/starting the server, and current activity monitoring. <br />
<br />
<strong>High Speed</strong><br />
Unlike other SSH tunneling FTP solutions, Blowfish encryption anddecryption is much faster and less CPU intensive, so transfers speedsare blindingly fast, and can easily support most corporate internetlinks. <br />
<br />
<strong>Intruder Detection</strong><br />
Whilst you are providing a service, you will always get the odd personwho will try to guess user authentication. Intruder Detection willautomatically ban IP addresses from trying to authenticate after anumber of unsuccessful attempts. <br />
<br />
<strong>Enforceable "Terms and Conditions"</strong><br />
You can optionally make users that connect agree to terms andconditions of use on the site. The user has to reply accordingly, orthey will be denied access. <br />
<br />
<strong>Resume uploads &amp;. downloads</strong><br />
Not all network conditions are perfect. EFTP has the ability to resume downloads as well as uploads for interrupted transfers. <br />
<br />
<strong>Highly configurable client &amp;. server</strong><br />
Fine tune your program to your liking in almost every way imaginable.Include login messages, logout messages, speed restrictions anddownload limits. <br />
<br />
<strong>Works with other FTP Clients/Servers</strong><br />
To achieve encryption, EFTP must be used at both client and server,however you can use both the Client and Server in non-encrypted modewith other popular Clients/Servers <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The client is free to use for home or business/corporate use. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></font></p>
