<p><font size="2">O&amp;O CleverCache Professional Edition - A unique tool to optimize your File Cache Management <br />
O&amp;O CleverCache is a unique application to optimize the File Cache Management of Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP. <br />
<br />
This results in an enormous performance boost and may double the original system speed - without any new hardware and without restricting your system's stability. <br />
<br />
Simply install O&amp;O CleverCache Pro and you are ready to go! Neither configuration nor rebooting is needed. Within 5 minutes, you activate unused resources of your Windows NT/2000/V4 system! The more the file cache grows, the less memory is available to running applications. <br />
<br />
The result is a significant performance loss, as requests for memory can lead to the so-called "swapping", i.e. currently unused memory areas are paged out to XP/2000/NT's paging file. O&amp;O CleverCache Pro takes over control of the resource management for file caching and applications. It prevents heavy system loading and guarantees the availability of a certain amount of memory. <br />
<br />
This leads to a performance increase and to lower response times, especially if you are running many applications at the same time and tend to switch between them quite often <br />
<br />
Here <br />
are some key features of "OO CleverCache": <br />
<br />
O&amp;O AutoSense <br />
· With O&amp;O AutoSense O&amp;O CleverCache 6 offers you a pre-defined profile that makes using the software a breeze. The O&amp;O AutoSense profile instructs your system to analyze your system's settings upon every system startup. Whenever changes to the main memory are detected, O&amp;O CleverCache 6 updates its settings accordingly. O&amp;O CleverCache 6 enables you to create your own profile according to your specific needs. This allows you to load your specialized cache settings whenever you need them. This could be, for instance, when you need to do some video editing or play your favorite PC games. O&amp;O CleverCache can also import and export your profiles as you choose. <br />
<br />
O&amp;O Mem-O-Free <br />
· O&amp;O CleverCache 6 also includes Mem-O-Free technology. Mem-O-Free gives you control over the amount of available memory in Windows. Whenever the amount of free memory falls below the user-defined threshold, Mem-O-Free is activated and frees up additional memory, forcing Windows to swap unneeded data to the hard disk. The result is more available memory for active applications bringing about a substantial rise in performance. <br />
<br />
O&amp;O Mem-O-Safe <br />
· When you save data to the hard disk, they are not immediately written to disk, but buffered in the internal file cache. After a certain amount of time, these data are written to the disk. How long this takes is determined by Windows, leaving users out the decision process. Windows considers system load as well as other parameters in determining the update interval, usually between 4 and 15 seconds. If during this period a system failure occurs, all data that has not been written to disk is lost. Critical data may be lost, sometimes necessitating a re-installation of Windows. This situation often occurs during a power failure, user error, or a system crash. O&amp;O CleverCache 6, with its Mem-O-Safe technology, lets you control and configure the update interval of the file cache on important file servers, for example, to minimize possible losses of data. The configuration of the interval can be changed through the O&amp;O CleverCache 6 applet found in the Control Panel. A short interval is especially important to File and Database Servers that hold critical Business data, in that it minimizes any loss of data sustained in a system crash. <br />
<br />
New: System Tuning <br />
· The System Tuning feature in O&amp;O CleverCache 6 includes a number of functions that can optimize or accelerate the performance of your operating system. These functions also give you access to system parameters not granted by the standard tools offered in Windows. <br />
<br />
System Monitor <br />
· The System Monitor enables you to monitor the condition and performance of the most important components of your PC System. With this feature you can receive real-time status reports on, amongst others, your processor, main memory, system cache, and the hard disk. <br />
<br />
<br />
