<p><font size="2"><p>VCDEasy will easily allow you to play and watch your video files (fromDV camcorder, DivX, DVD,...), your pictures (from digital camera,scanner,...) and your audio files (music, audio comments,...) directlyon most of the home DVD players, without having to buy a DVD Writer andDVD discs. How ? VCDEasy allows you to build easily VideoCDs(VCD/SVCD)! <br />
<br />
A VCD ("Video Compact Disc") is a CD (CD-R or CD-RW, so cheap) that cancontain up to 80 minutes video, up to 1980 pictures, up to 6 hours ofaudio (CD sound quality), or a mix of them. <br />
<br />
On a VCD, it is also possible to have menus and chapters, similiar to DVDs. You can also have simple photo album/slide shows. <br />
<br />
The same way most of the home DVD player and computers can play AudioCDs, a VCD can be played on almost all standalone DVD players (only afew persons know that!) and of course on all computers with a DVD-ROMor CD-ROM drive with the help of a software player.<br />
<br />
Invented by Philips, the VCD is bornt before the DVD. VCD is a cheapway to make at home DVD like discs. As opposed to a DivX CD, a VCD canbe played on almost all home DVD players, i.e watched on a TV. <br />
<br />
No need to have a computer, no need to configure it to play DivX films... Watching a VideoCD is as simple as watching a DVD! <br />
<br />
The VideoCD, for example, is a really great solution to share videosand pictures with familly and friends, they only need a DVD Player anda TV!<br />
<br />
All you need to do is to provide VCDEasy with MPEG files compliant withthe VideoCD specifications (A MPEG pictures encoder is already includedinto VCDEasy, a MPEG audio only files encoder will be included intoVCDEasy soon, and use for example the excellent TMPGEnc encode to MPEGyour videos). <br />
<br />
Novice users can simply select (VideoCD ready) MPEG files and clickthe go button, while advanced users can configure/use almost allaspects of the VideoCD specifications (PlayBack Control basedinteractivity, Chapters, Menus support, CD-i support...).<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Limitations:</strong></span><br />
<br />
No files bigger than 200 MB<br />
No more than 5 MPEG picture/audio files and 2 MPEG video files(instead of up to 1980 MPEG picture/audio files and 98 Video Max).<br />
You can save projects but not reload them.<br />
No "Execute an (S)VCD XML file" in the tools<br />
All MPEG Stills have www.vcdeasy.org as watermark<br />
Project files and MPEG analyzes cache files are not in the clear.<br />
You can not disable the "Check for new version once per day" feature.</p></p></p>
