<p><font size="2">Dr.Hardware ist made for everyone. It will help both the expert and thenovice to answer all questions regarding hardware, configuration andpower of his computer. Dr. Hardware is an useful diagnostic utilitythat will come in handy.<br />
<br />
Dr. Hardware concentrates his efforts on detecting and inquiring thecore hardware and the connected devices of your computer. Also severalrelevant information about resources and operating system will be given.<br />
<br />
It shows the really relevant information: important hardware data aswell as somewhat sophisticated stuff, that can become of interest undercertain circumstances, for example when dealing with the customerservice.<br />
For experts the program also provides the underlying data structures,e.g. dump of the PCI configuration space or of SDRAM modules eeprom.<br />
<br />
Several charts and diagrams visualize data relations, e.g. free vs. used drive capacity or benchmark results.<br />
<br />
Finally its worth to mention that all data are written to andmaintained within a database consisting of numerous tables and you areable to edit these data in the programs text fields and grids, thatshow the results. <br />
<br />
Dr. Hardware covers the whole machine and includes not only the commonstuff (like processor detection etc.) but also some more sophisticatedtests like hardware sensor, ATA/S-ATA/Atapi and network analysis.<br />
