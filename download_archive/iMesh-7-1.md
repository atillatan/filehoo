<p style="fix-download-text !important">
<p><font size="2">iMesh is a peer-to-peer file-sharing program that lets you find, download, share and publish audio and video files, computer games, images, photos and just about any document, within a growing community of millions. <br />
<br />
Files are located on the computers of other iMesh users who have agreed to share them. Files can be transferred directly from one desktop to another without the need for a server. Its technology allows you to download files from multiple users simultaneously. iMesh also supports an advanced resume feature that ensures the automatic completion of all your requested downloads. <br />
<br />
iMesh makes file sharing even better, with great new features including multinetworking (search simultaneously on other file-sharing networks such as Gnutella) and a new, friendlier user interface.</font></p></p>
